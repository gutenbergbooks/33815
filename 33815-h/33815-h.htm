<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The strangest figure that meets us in the annals of Oriental
thought is that of Confucius. To the popular mind he is the
founder of a religion, and yet he has nothing in common
with the great religious teachers of the East. We think of
Siddartha, the founder of Buddhism, as the very impersonation
of romantic asceticism, enthusiastic self-sacrifice,
and faith in the things that are invisible. Zoroaster is the
friend of God, talking face to face with the Almighty, and
drinking wisdom and knowledge from the lips of Omniscience.
Mohammed is represented as snatched up into
heaven, where he receives the Divine communication
which he is bidden to propagate with fire and sword
throughout the world. These great teachers lived in an atmosphere
of the supernatural. They spoke with the authority
of inspired prophets. They brought the unseen
world close to the minds of their disciples. They spoke
positively of immortality, of reward or punishment beyond
the grave. The present life they despised, the future
was to them everything in its promised satisfaction. The
teachings of Confucius were of a very different sort.
Throughout his whole writings he has not even mentioned
the name of God. He declined to discuss the question of
immortality. When he was asked about spiritual beings, he
remarked, "If we cannot even know men, how can we
know spirits?"</p>

<p>Yet this was the man the impress of whose teaching has
formed the national character of five hundred millions of
people. A temple to Confucius stands to this day in every
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
town and village of China. His precepts are committed to
memory by every child from the tenderest age, and each
year at the royal university at Pekin the Emperor holds a
festival in honor of the illustrious teacher.</p>

<p>The influence of Confucius springs, first of all, from the
narrowness and definiteness of his doctrine. He was no
transcendentalist, and never meddled with supramundane
things. His teaching was of the earth, earthy; it dealt entirely
with the common relations of life, and the Golden
Rule he must necessarily have stumbled upon, as the most
obvious canon of his system. He strikes us as being the
great Stoic of the East, for he believed that virtue was
based on knowledge, knowledge of a man's own heart, and
knowledge of human-kind. There is a pathetic resemblance
between the accounts given of the death of Confucius and
the death of Zeno. Both died almost without warning in
dreary hopelessness, without the ministrations of either
love or religion. This may be a mere coincidence, but the
lives and teachings of both men must have led them to
look with indifference upon such an end. For Confucius in
his teaching treated only of man's life on earth, and seems
to have had no ideas with regard to the human lot after
death; if he had any ideas he preserved an inscrutable
silence about them. As a moralist he prescribed the duties
of the king and of the father, and advocated the cultivation
by the individual man of that rest or apathy of mind
which resembles so much the disposition aimed at by the
Greek and Roman Stoic. Even as a moralist, he seems to
have sacrificed the ideal to the practical, and his loose notions
about marriage, his tolerance of concubinage, the
slight emphasis which he lays on the virtue of veracity&mdash;of
which indeed he does not seem himself to have been
particularly studious in his historic writings&mdash;place him
low down in the rank of moralists. Yet he taught what he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
felt the people could receive, and the flat mediocrity of
his character and his teachings has been stamped forever
upon a people who, while they are kindly, gentle, forbearing,
and full of family piety, are palpably lacking not only
in the exaltation of Mysticism, but in any religious feeling,
generally so-called.</p>

<p>The second reason that made the teaching of Confucius
so influential is based on the circumstances of the time.
When this thoughtful, earnest youth awoke to the consciousness
of life about him, he saw that the abuses under
which the people groaned sprang from the feudal system,
which cut up the country into separate territories, over
which the power of the king had no control. China was in
the position of France in the years preceding Philippe-Auguste,
excepting that there were no places of sanctuary
and no Truce of God. The great doctrine of Confucius was
the unlimited despotism of the Emperor, and his moral
precepts were intended to teach the Emperor how to use
his power aright. But the Emperor was only typical of all
those in authority&mdash;the feudal duke, the judge on the
bench, and the father of the family. Each could discharge
his duties aright only by submitting to the moral discipline
which Confucius prescribed. A vital element in this system
is its conservatism, its adherence to the imperial idea. As
James I said, "No bishop, no king," so the imperialists of
China have found in Confucianism the strongest basis for
the throne, and have supported its dissemination accordingly.</p>

<p>The Analects of Confucius contain the gist of his teachings,
and is worthy of study. We find in this work most of
the precepts which his disciples have preserved and recorded.
They form a code remarkable for simplicity, even
crudity, and we are compelled to admire the force of character,
the practical sagacity, the insight into the needs of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the hour, which enabled Confucius, without claiming any
Divine sanction, to impose this system upon his countrymen.</p>

<p>The name Confucius is only the Latinized form of two
words which mean "Master K&lsquo;ung." He was born 551 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
his father being governor of Shantung. He was married at
nineteen, and seems to have occupied some minor position
under the government. In his twenty-fourth year he
entered upon the three years' mourning for the death of
his mother. His seclusion gave him time for deep thought
and the study of history, and he resolved upon the regeneration
of his unhappy country. By the time he was thirty
he became known as a great teacher, and disciples flocked
to him. But he was yet occupied in public duties, and rose
through successive stages to the office of Chief Judge in
his own country of Lu. His tenure of office is said to have
put an end to crime, and he became the "idol of the people"
in his district. The jealousy of the feudal lords was roused
by his fame as a moral teacher and a blameless judge. Confucius
was driven from his home, and wandered about,
with a few disciples, until his sixty-ninth year, when he returned
to Lu, after accomplishing a work which has borne
fruit, such as it is, to the present day. He spent the remaining
five years of his life in editing the odes and historic
monuments in which the glories of the ancient Chinese
dynasty are set forth. He died in his seventy-third year,
478 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> There can be no doubt that the success of Confucius
has been singularly great, owing especially to the
narrow scope of his scheme, which has become crystallized
in the habits, usages, and customs of the people. Especially
has it been instrumental in consolidating the empire, and
in strengthening the power of the monarch, who, as he
every year burns incense in the red-walled temple at
Pekin, utters sincerely the invocation: "Great art thou, O
perfect Sage! Thy virtue is full, thy doctrine complete.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Among mortal men there has not been thine equal. All
kings honor thee. Thy statutes and laws have come gloriously
down. Thou art the pattern in this imperial school.
Reverently have the sacrificial vessels been set out. Full
of awe, we sound our drums and bells."</p>

<h2>BOOK I</h2>
<h3><i>On Learning&mdash;Miscellaneous Sayings</i></h3>

<p>"To learn," said the Master, "and then to practise opportunely
what one has learnt&mdash;does not this bring with it a
sense of satisfaction?</p>

<p>"To have associates in study coming to one from distant
parts&mdash;does not this also mean pleasure in store?</p>

<p>"And are not those who, while not comprehending all
that is said, still remain not unpleased to hear, men of the
superior order?"</p>

<p>A saying of the Scholar Yu:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is rarely the case that those who act the part of true
men in regard to their duty to parents and elder brothers
are at the same time willing to turn currishly upon their
superiors: it has never yet been the case that such as desire
not to commit that offence have been men willing to promote
anarchy or disorder.</p>

<p>"Men of superior mind busy themselves first in getting
at the root of things; and when they have succeeded in this
the right course is open to them. Well, are not filial piety
and friendly subordination among brothers a root of that
right feeling which is owing generally from man to man?"</p>

<p>The Master observed, "Rarely do we meet with the
right feeling due from one man to another where there is
fine speech and studied mien."</p>

<p>The Scholar Tsang once said of himself: "On three
points I examine myself daily, viz., whether, in looking
after other people's interests, I have not been acting whole-heartedly;
whether, in my intercourse with friends, I have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
not been true; and whether, after teaching, I have not myself
been practising what I have taught."</p>

<p>The Master once observed that to rule well one of the
larger States meant strict attention to its affairs and conscientiousness
on the part of the ruler; careful husbanding
of its resources, with at the same time a tender care for the
interests of all classes; and the employing of the masses in
the public service at suitable seasons.</p>

<p>"Let young people," said he, "show filial piety at home,
respectfulness towards their elders when away from home;
let them be circumspect, be truthful; their love going out
freely towards all, cultivating good-will to men. And if, in
such a walk, there be time or energy left for other things,
let them employ it in the acquisition of literary or artistic
accomplishments."</p>

<p>The disciple Tsz-hiÃ¡ said, "The appreciation of worth in
men of worth, thus diverting the mind from lascivious desires&mdash;ministering
to parents while one is the most capable
of so doing&mdash;serving one's ruler when one is able to devote
himself entirely to that object&mdash;being sincere in one's language
in intercourse with friends: this I certainly must
call evidence of learning, though others may say there has
been 'no learning.'"</p>

<p>Sayings of the Master:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If the great man be not grave, he will not be revered,
neither can his learning be solid.</p>

<p>"Give prominent place to loyalty and sincerity.</p>

<p>"Have no associates in study who are not advanced
somewhat like yourself.</p>

<p>"When you have erred, be not afraid to correct yourself."</p>

<p>A saying of the Scholar Tsang:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The virtue of the people is renewed and enriched when
attention is seen to be paid to the departed, and the remembrance
of distant ancestors kept and cherished."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
    Tsz-k&lsquo;in put this query to his fellow disciple Tsz-kung:
said he, "When our Master comes to this or that State, he
learns without fail how it is being governed. Does he investigate
matters? or are the facts given him?"</p>

<p>Tsz-kung answered, "Our Master is a man of pleasant
manners, and of probity, courteous, moderate, and unassuming:
it is by his being such that he arrives at the facts.
Is not his way of arriving at things different from that of
others?"</p>

<p>A saying of the Master:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He who, after three years' observation of the will of his
father when alive, or of his past conduct if dead, does not
deviate from that father's ways, is entitled to be called 'a
dutiful son.'"</p>

<p>Sayings of the Scholar Yu:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For the practice of the Rules of Propriety,
    <a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> one excellent
way is to be natural. This naturalness became a great
grace in the practice of kings of former times; let everyone,
small or great, follow their example.</p>

<p>"It is not, however, always practicable; and it is not so
in the case of a person who does things naturally, knowing
that he should act so, and yet who neglects to regulate his
acts according to the Rules.</p>

<p>"When truth and right are hand in hand, a statement
will bear repetition. When respectfulness and propriety go
hand in hand, disgrace and shame are kept afar-off. Remove
all occasion for alienating those to whom you are
bound by close ties, and you have them still to resort to."</p>

<p>A saying of the Master:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The man of greater mind who, when he is eating, craves
not to eat to the full; who has a home, but craves not for
comforts in it; who is active and earnest in his work and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
careful in his words; who makes towards men of high principle,
and so maintains his own rectitude&mdash;that man may
be styled a devoted student."</p>

<p>Tsz-kung asked, "What say you, sir, of the poor who do
not cringe and fawn; and what of the rich who are without
pride and haughtiness?" "They are passable," the
Master replied; "yet they are scarcely in the same category
as the poor who are happy, and the rich who love propriety."</p>

<p>"In the 'Book of the Odes,'" Tsz-kung went on to say,
"we read of one</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Polished, as by the knife and file,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The graving-tool, the smoothing-stone.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Does that coincide with your remark?"</p>

<p>"Ah! such as you," replied the Master, "may well commence
a discussion on the Odes. If one tell you how a
thing goes, you know what ought to come."</p>

<p>"It does not greatly concern me," said the Master, "that
men do not know me; my great concern is, my not knowing
them."</p>

<h2>BOOK II</h2>
<h3><i>Good Government&mdash;Filial Piety&mdash;The Superior Man</i></h3>

<p>Sayings of the Master:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let a ruler base his government upon virtuous principles,
and he will be like the pole-star, which remains
steadfast in its place, while all the host of stars turn towards
it.</p>

<p>"The 'Book of Odes' contains three hundred pieces, but
one expression in it may be taken as covering the purport
of all, viz., Unswerving mindfulness.</p>

<p>"To govern simply by statute, and to reduce all to order
by means of pains and penalties, is to render the people
evasive, and devoid of any sense of shame.</p>

<p>"To govern upon principles of virtue, and to reduce
them to order by the Rules of Propriety, would not only
create in them the sense of shame, but would moreover
reach them in all their errors.</p>

<p>"When I attained the age of fifteen, I became bent upon
study. At thirty, I was a confirmed student. At forty,
nought could move me from my course. At fifty, I comprehended
the will and decrees of Heaven. At sixty, my
ears were attuned to them. At seventy, I could follow my
heart's desires, without overstepping the lines of rectitude."</p>

<p>To a question of Mang-i, as to what filial piety consisted
in, the Master replied, "In not being perverse." Afterwards,
when Fan Ch&lsquo;i was driving him, the Master informed
him of this question and answer, and Fan Ch&lsquo;i
asked, "What was your meaning?" The Master replied, "I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
meant that the Rules of Propriety should always be adhered
to in regard to those who brought us into the world:
in ministering to them while living, in burying them when
dead, and afterwards in the offering to them of sacrificial
gifts."</p>

<p>To a query of Mang Wu respecting filial piety, the Master
replied, "Parents ought to bear but one trouble&mdash;that
of their own sickness."</p>

<p>To a like question put by Tsz-yu, his reply was this:
"The filial piety of the present day simply means the being
able to support one's parents&mdash;which extends even to the
case of dogs and horses, all of which may have something
to give in the way of support. If there be no reverential
feeling in the matter, what is there to distinguish between
the cases?"</p>

<p>To a like question of Tsz-hiÃ¡, he replied: "The manner
is the difficulty. If, in the case of work to be done, the
younger folks simply take upon themselves the toil of it;
or if, in the matter of meat and drink, they simply set these
before their elders&mdash;is this to be taken as filial piety?"</p>

<p>Once the Master remarked, "I have conversed with
HwÃºi the whole day long, and he has controverted nothing
that I have said, as if he were without wits. But when
his back was turned, and I looked attentively at his conduct
apart from me, I found it satisfactory in all its issues.
No, indeed! HwÃºi is not without his wits."</p>

<p>Other observations of the Master:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you observe what things people (usually) take in
hand, watch their motives, and note particularly what it is
that gives them satisfaction, shall they be able to conceal
from you what they are? Conceal themselves, indeed!</p>

<p>"Be versed in ancient lore, and familiarize yourself with
the modern; then may you become teachers.</p>

<p>"The great man is not a mere receptacle."</p>

<p>In reply to Tsz-kung respecting the great man:&mdash;-</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
    "What he first says, as a result of his experience, he
afterwards follows up.</p>

<p>"The great man is catholic-minded, and not one-sided.
The common man is the reverse.</p>

<p>"Learning, without thought, is a snare; thought, without
learning, is a danger.</p>

<p>"Where the mind is set much upon heterodox principles&mdash;there
truly and indeed is harm."</p>

<p>To the disciple of Tsz-lu the Master said, "Shall I give
you a lesson about knowledge? When you know a thing,
maintain that you know it; and when you do not, acknowledge
your ignorance. This is characteristic of knowledge."</p>

<p>Tsz-chang was studying with an eye to official income.
The Master addressed him thus: "Of the many things you
hear hold aloof from those that are doubtful, and speak
guardedly with reference to the rest; your mistakes will
then be few. Also, of the many courses you see adopted,
hold aloof from those that are risky, and carefully follow
the others; you will then seldom have occasion for regret.
Thus, being seldom mistaken in your utterances, and having
few occasions for regret in the line you take, you are on
the high road to your preferment."</p>

<p>To a question put to him by Duke Ngai
    <a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as to what
should be done in order to render the people submissive to
authority, Confucius replied, "Promote the straightforward,
and reject those whose courses are crooked, and the
thing will be effected. Promote the crooked and reject the
straightforward, and the effect will be the reverse."</p>

<p>When Ki K&lsquo;ang<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
    asked of him how the people could be
induced to show respect, loyalty, and willingness to be led,
the Master answered, "Let there be grave dignity in him
who has the oversight of them, and they will show him respect;
let him be seen to be good to his own parents, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
kindly in disposition, and they will be loyal to him; let him
promote those who have ability, and see to the instruction
of those who have it not, and they will be willing to be
led."</p>

<p>Some one, speaking to Confucius, inquired, "Why, sir,
are you not an administrator of government?" The Master
rejoined, "What says the 'Book of the Annals,' with reference
to filial duty?&mdash;'Make it a point to be dutiful to your
parents and amicable with your brethren; the same duties
extend to an administrator.' If these, then, also make an
administrator, how am I to take your words about being
an administrator?"</p>

<p>On one occasion the Master remarked, "I know not what
men are good for, on whose word no reliance can be
placed. How should your carriages, large or little, get
along without your whipple-trees or swing-trees?"</p>

<p>Tsz-chang asked if it were possible to forecast the state
of the country ten generations hence. The Master replied
in this manner: "The Yin dynasty adopted the rules and
manners of the HiÃ¡ line of kings, and it is possible to tell
whether it retrograded or advanced. The Chow line has
followed the Yin, adopting its ways, and whether there has
been deterioration or improvement may also be determined.
Some other line may take up in turn those of Chow;
and supposing even this process to go on for a hundred
generations, the result may be known."</p>

<p>Other sayings of the Master:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is but flattery to make sacrificial offerings to departed
spirits not belonging to one's own family.</p>

<p>"It is moral cowardice to leave undone what one perceives
to be right to do."</p>

<h2>BOOK III</h2>
<h3><i>Abuse of Proprieties in Ceremonial and Music</i></h3>

<p>Alluding to the head of the Ki family,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and the eight lines
of posturers<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> before their ancestral hall, Confucius remarked,
"If the Ki can allow himself to go to this extent,
to what extent will he not allow himself to go?"</p>

<p>The Three Families<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> were in the habit, during the Removal
of the sacred vessels after sacrifice, of using the
hymn commencing</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Harmoniously the Princes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Draw near with reverent tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assisting in his worship<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Heaven's Son, the great and dread."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"How," exclaimed the Master, "can such words be appropriated
in <a name="in" id="in"></a>the ancestral hall of the <a name="Three" id="Three"></a>Three Families?"</p>

<p>"Where a man," said he again, "has not the proper feelings
due from one man to another, how will he stand as
regards the Rules of Propriety? And in such a case, what
shall we say of his sense of harmony?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
    On a question being put to him by Lin Fang, a disciple,
as to what was the radical idea upon which the Rules of
Propriety were based, the Master exclaimed, "Ah! that is a
large question. As to some rules, where there is likelihood
of extravagance, they would rather demand economy; in
those which relate to mourning, and where there is likelihood
of being easily satisfied, what is wanted is real sorrow."</p>

<p>Speaking of the disorder of the times he remarked that
while the barbarians on the North and East had their
Chieftains, we here in this great country had nothing to
compare with them in that respect:&mdash;we had lost these distinctions!</p>

<p>Alluding to the matter of the Chief of the Ki family
worshipping on T&lsquo;ai-shan,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the Master said to Yen Yu,
"Cannot you save him from this?" He replied, "It is beyond
my power." "Alas, alas!" exclaimed the Master, "are we to
say that the spirits of T&lsquo;ai-shan have not as much discernment
as Lin Fang?"</p>

<p>Of "the superior man," the Master observed, "In him
there is no contentiousness. Say even that he does certainly
contend with others, as in archery competitions; yet mark,
in that case, how courteously he will bow and go up for
the forfeit-cup, and come down again and give it to his
competitor. In his very contest he is still the superior man."</p>

<p>Tsz-hiÃ¡ once inquired what inference might be drawn
from the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dimples playing in witching smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beautiful eyes, so dark, so bright!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, and her face may be thought the while<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Colored by art, red rose on white!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Coloring," replied the Master, "requires a pure and clear
background." "Then," said the other, "rules of ceremony
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
require to have a background!" "Ah!" exclaimed the Master,
"you are the man to catch the drift of my thought.
Such as you may well introduce a discussion on the Odes."</p>

<p>Said the Master, "As regards the ceremonial adopted
and enforced by the HiÃ¡ dynasty, I am able to describe it,
although their own descendants in the State of Ki can adduce
no adequate testimony in favor of its use there. So,
too, I am able to describe the ceremonial of the Yin dynasty,
although no more can the Sung people show sufficient
reason for its continuance amongst themselves. And
why cannot they do so? Because they have not documents
enough, nor men learned enough. If only they had such, I
could refer them to them in support of their usages.</p>

<p>"When I am present at the great quinquennial sacrifice
to the <i>manes</i> of the royal ancestors," the Master said, "from
the pouring-out of the oblation onwards, I have no heart
to look on."</p>

<p>Some one asked what was the purport of this great sacrifice,
and the Master replied, "I cannot tell. The position in
the empire of him who could tell you is as evident as when
you look at this"&mdash;pointing to the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>When he offered sacrifices to his ancestors, he used to
act as if they were present before him. In offering to other
spirits it was the same.</p>

<p>He would say, "If I do not myself take part in my offerings,
it is all the same as if I did not offer them."</p>

<p>Wang-sun KiÃ¡ asked him once, "What says the proverb,
'Better to court favor in the kitchen than in the drawing-room'?"
The Master replied, "Nay, better say, He who has
sinned against Heaven has none other to whom prayer
may be addressed."</p>

<p>Of the Chow dynasty the Master remarked, "It looks
back upon two other dynasties; and what a rich possession
it has in its records of those times! I follow Chow!"</p>

<p>On his first entry into the grand temple, he inquired
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
about every matter connected with its usages. Some one
thereupon remarked, "Who says that the son of the man
of Tsou<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
    understands about ceremonial? On entering the
grand temple he inquired about everything." This remark
coming to the Master's ears, he said, "What I did is part
of the ceremonial!"</p>

<p>"In archery," he said, "the great point to be observed is
not simply the perforation of the leather; for men have not
all the same strength. That was the fashion in the olden
days."</p>

<p>Once, seeing that his disciple Tsz-kung was desirous
that the ceremonial observance of offering a sheep at the
new moon might be dispensed with, the Master said, "Ah!
you grudge the loss of the sheep; I grudge the loss of the
ceremony."</p>

<p>"To serve one's ruler nowadays," he remarked, "fully
complying with the Rules of Propriety, is regarded by
others as toadyism!"</p>

<p>When Duke Ting questioned him as to how a prince
should deal with his ministers, and how they in turn should
serve their prince, Confucius said in reply, "In dealing
with his ministers a prince should observe the proprieties;
in serving his prince a minister should observe the duty of
loyalty."</p>

<p>Referring to the First of the Odes, he remarked that it
was mirthful without being lewd, and sad also without
being painful.</p>

<p>Duke Ngai asked the disciple Tsai Wo respecting the
places for sacrificing to the Earth. The latter replied, "The
Family of the Great Yu, of the HiÃ¡ dynasty, chose a place
of pine trees; the Yin founders chose cypresses; and the
Chow founders chestnut trees, solemn and majestic, to inspire,
'tis said, the people with feelings of awe."</p>

<p>The Master on hearing of this exclaimed, "Never an allusion
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
to things that have been enacted in the past! Never a
remonstrance against what is now going on! He has gone
away without a word of censure."</p>

<p>The Master once said of Kwan Chung,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> "A small-minded
man indeed!"</p>

<p>"Was he miserly?" some one asked.</p>

<p>"Miserly, indeed!" said he; "not that: he married three
times, and he was not a man who restricted his official
business to too few hands&mdash;how could he be miserly?"</p>

<p>"He knew the Rules of Propriety, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Judge:&mdash;Seeing that the feudal lords planted a screen
at their gates, he too would have one at his! Seeing that
when any two of the feudal lords met in friendly conclave
they had an earthenware stand on which to place their inverted
cups after drinking, he must have the same! If he
knew the Rules of Propriety, who is there that does not
know them?"</p>

<p>In a discourse to the Chief Preceptor of Music at the
court of Lu, the Master said, "Music is an intelligible thing.
When you begin a performance, let all the various instruments
produce as it were one sound (inharmonious); then,
as you go on, bring out the harmony fully, distinctly, and
with uninterrupted flow, unto the end."</p>

<p>The warden of the border-town of I requested an interview
with Confucius, and said, "When great men have
come here, I have never yet failed to obtain a sight of
them." The followers introduced him; and, on leaving, he
said to them, "Sirs, why grieve at his loss of office? The
empire has for long been without good government; and
Heaven is about to use your master as its edict-announcer."</p>

<p>Comparing the music of the emperor Shun with the music
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of King Wu, the Master said, "That of Shun is beautiful
throughout, and also good throughout. That of Wu is all of
it beautiful, but scarcely all of it good."</p>

<p>"High station," said the Master, "occupied by men who
have no large and generous heart; ceremonial performed
with no reverence; duties of mourning engaging the attention,
where there is absence of sorrow;&mdash;how should I look
on, where this is the state of things?"</p>

    These posturers were mutes who took part in the ritual of the ancestral

eight men. Only in the sovereign's household should there have been eight
lines of them; a ducal family like the Ki should have had but six lines; a
great official had four, and one of lower grade two. These were the gradations
marking the status of families, and Confucius's sense of propriety was
offended at the Ki's usurping in this way the appearance of royalty.</p>

<h2>BOOK IV</h2>
<h3><i>Social Virtue&mdash;Superior and Inferior Man</i></h3>

<p>Sayings of the Master:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is social good feeling that gives charm to a neighborhood.
And where is the wisdom of those who choose an
abode where it does not abide?</p>

<p>"Those who are without it cannot abide long, either in
straitened or in happy circumstances. Those who possess it
find contentment in it. Those who are wise go after it as
men go after gain.</p>

<p>"Only they in whom it exists can have right likings and
dislikings for others.</p>

<p>"Where the will is set upon it, there will be no room for
malpractices.</p>

<p>"Riches and honor are what men desire; but if they arrive
at them by improper ways, they should not continue
to hold them. Poverty and low estate are what men dislike;
but if they arrive at such a condition by improper ways,
they should not refuse it.</p>

<p>"If the 'superior man' make nought of social good feeling,
how shall he fully bear that name?</p>

<p>"Not even whilst he eats his meal will the 'superior man'
forget what he owes to his fellow-men. Even in hurried
leave-takings, even in moments of frantic confusion, he
keeps true to this virtue.</p>

<p>"I have not yet seen a lover of philanthropy, nor a hater
of misanthropy&mdash;such, that the former did not take occasion
to magnify that virtue in himself, and that the latter,
in his positive practice of philanthropy, did not, at times,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
allow in his presence something savoring of misanthropy.</p>

<p>"Say you, is there any one who is able for one whole day
to apply the energy of his mind to this virtue? Well, I have
not seen any one whose energy was not equal to it. It may
be there are such, but I have never met with them.</p>

<p>"The faults of individuals are peculiar to their particular
class and surroundings; and it is by observing their faults
that one comes to understand the condition of their good
feelings towards their fellows.</p>

<p>"One may hear the right way in the morning, and at
evening die.</p>

<p>"The scholar who is intent upon learning the right way,
and who is yet ashamed of poor attire and poor food, is not
worthy of being discoursed with.</p>

<p>"The masterly man's attitude to the world is not exclusively
this or that: whatsoever is right, to that he will be a
party.</p>

<p>"The masterly man has an eye to virtue, the common
man, to earthly things; the former has an eye to penalties
for error&mdash;the latter, to favor.</p>

<p>"Where there is habitual going after gain, there is much
ill-will.</p>

<p>"When there is ability in a ruler to govern a country by
adhering to the Rules of Propriety, and by kindly condescension,
what is wanted more? Where the ability to
govern thus is wanting, what has such a ruler to do with
the Rules of Propriety?</p>

<p>"One should not be greatly concerned at not being in
office; but rather about the requirements in one's self for
such a standing. Neither should one be so much concerned
at being unknown; but rather with seeking to become
worthy of being known."</p>

<p>Addressing his disciple Tsang Sin, the Master said,
"Tsang Sin, the principles which I inculcate have one main
idea upon which they all hang." "Aye, surely," he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
    When the Master was gone out the other disciples asked
what was the purport of this remark. Tsang's answer was,
"The principles of our Master's teaching are these&mdash;-whole-heartedness
and kindly forbearance; these and nothing
more."</p>

<p>Other observations of the Master:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Men of loftier mind manifest themselves in their equitable
dealings; small-minded men in their going after gain.</p>

<p>"When you meet with men of worth, think how you may
attain to their level; when you see others of an opposite
character, look within, and examine yourself.</p>

<p>"A son, in ministering to his parents, may (on occasion)
offer gentle remonstrances; when he sees that their will is
not to heed such, he should nevertheless still continue to
show them reverent respect, never obstinacy; and if he
have to suffer, let him do so without murmuring.</p>

<p>"Whilst the parents are still living, he should not wander
far; or, if a wanderer, he should at least have some fixed
address.</p>

<p>"If for three years he do not veer from the principles of
his father, he may be called a dutiful son.</p>

<p>"A son should not ignore the years of his parents. On the
one hand, they may be a matter for rejoicing (that they
have been so many), and on the other, for apprehension
(that so few remain).</p>

<p>"People in olden times were loth to speak out, fearing
the disgrace of not being themselves as good as their
words.</p>

<p>"Those who keep within restraints are seldom losers.</p>

<p>"To be slow to speak, but prompt to act, is the desire of
the 'superior man.'</p>

<p>"Virtue dwells not alone: she must have neighbors."</p>

<p>An observation of Tsz-yu:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Officiousness, in the service of princes, leads to disgrace;
among friends, to estrangement."</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<h2>BOOK V</h2>
<h3><i>A Disciple and the Golden Rule&mdash;Miscellaneous</i></h3>

<p>The Master pronounced Kung-ye Ch&lsquo;ang, a disciple, to
be a marriageable person; for although lying bound in
criminal fetters he had committed no crime. And he gave
him his own daughter to wife.</p>

<p>Of Nan Yung, a disciple, he observed, that in a State
where the government was well conducted he would not
be passed over in its appointments, and in one where the
government was ill conducted he would evade punishment
and disgrace. And he caused his elder brother's daughter
to be given in marriage to him.</p>

<p>Of Tsz-tsien, a disciple, he remarked, "A superior man
indeed is the like of him! But had there been none of
superior quality in Lu, how should this man have attained
to this excellence?"</p>

<p>Tsz-kung asked, "What of me, then?" "You," replied the
Master&mdash;"You are a receptacle." "Of what sort?" said he.
"One for high and sacred use," was the answer.</p>

<p>Some one having observed of Yen Yung that he was
good-natured towards others, but that he lacked the gift
of ready speech, the Master said, "What need of that gift?
To stand up before men and pour forth a stream of glib
words is generally to make yourself obnoxious to them. I
know not about his good-naturedness; but at any rate what
need of that gift?"</p>

<p>When the Master proposed that Tsi-tiau K&lsquo;ai should
enter the government service, the latter replied, "I can
scarcely credit it." The Master was gratified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
    "Good principles are making no progress," once exclaimed
the Master. "If I were to take a raft, and drift
about on the sea, would Tsz-lu, I wonder, be my follower
there?" That disciple was delighted at hearing the suggestion;
whereupon the Master continued, "He surpasses me
in his love of deeds of daring. But he does not in the least
grasp the pith of my remark."</p>

<p>In reply to a question put to him by Mang Wu respecting
Tsz-lu&mdash;as to whether he might be called good-natured
towards others, the Master said, "I cannot tell";
but, on the question being put again, he answered, "Well,
in an important State<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> he might be intrusted with the management
of the military levies; but I cannot answer for his
good nature."</p>

<p>"What say you then of Yen Yu?"</p>

<p>"As for Yen," he replied, "in a city of a thousand families,
or in a secondary fief,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> he might be charged with the governorship;
but I cannot answer for his good-naturedness."</p>

<p>"Take Tsz-hwa, then; what of him?"</p>

<p>"Tsz-hwa," said he, "with a cincture girt upon him,
standing as attendant at Court, might be charged with the
addressing of visitors and guests; but as to his good-naturedness
I cannot answer."</p>

<p>Addressing Tsz-kung, the Master said, "Which of the
two is ahead of the other&mdash;yourself or HwÃºi?" "How shall
I dare," he replied, "even to look at HwÃºi? Only let him
hear one particular, and from that he knows ten; whereas
I, if I hear one, may from it know two."</p>

<p>"You are not a match for him, I grant you," said the
Master. "You are not his match."</p>

<p>Tsai Yu, a disciple, used to sleep in the daytime. Said
the Master, "One may hardly carve rotten wood, or use a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
trowel to the wall of a manure-yard! In his case, what is
the use of reprimand?</p>

<p>"My attitude towards a man in my first dealings with
him," he added, "was to listen to his professions and to
trust to his conduct. My attitude now is to listen to his
professions, and to watch his conduct. My experience with
Tsai Yu has led to this change.</p>

<p>"I have never seen," said the Master, "a man of inflexible
firmness." Some one thereupon mentioned Shin Ch&lsquo;ang, a
disciple. "Ch&lsquo;ang," said he, "is wanton; where do you get
at his inflexibleness?"</p>

<p>Tsz-kung made the remark: "That which I do not wish
others to put upon me, I also wish not to put upon others."
"Nay," said the Master, "you have not got so far as that."</p>

<p>The same disciple once remarked, "There may be access
so as to hear the Master's literary discourses, but when he
is treating of human nature and the way of Heaven, there
may not be such success."</p>

<p>Tsz-lu, after once hearing him upon some subject, and
feeling himself as yet incompetent to carry into practice
what he had heard, used to be apprehensive only lest he
should hear the subject revived.</p>

<p>Tsz-kung asked how it was that Kung Wan had come to
be so styled Wan (the talented). The Master's answer
was, "Because, though a man of an active nature, he was
yet fond of study, and he was not ashamed to stoop to put
questions to his inferiors."</p>

<p>Respecting Tsz-ch&lsquo;an,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the Master said that he had four
of the essential qualities of the 'superior man':&mdash;in his own
private walk he was humble-minded; in serving his superiors
he was deferential; in his looking after the material
welfare of the people he was generously kind; and in his
exaction of public service from the latter he was just.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
    Speaking of Yen Ping, he said, "He was one who was
happy in his mode of attaching men to him. However long
the intercourse, he was always deferential to them."</p>

<p>Referring to Tsang Wan, he asked, "What is to be said
of this man's discernment?&mdash;this man with his tortoise-house,
with the pillar-heads and posts bedizened with
scenes of hill and mere!"</p>

<p>Tsz-chang put a question relative to the chief Minister
of Tsu, Tsz-wan. He said, "Three times he became chief
Minister, and on none of these occasions did he betray any
sign of exultation. Three times his ministry came to an
end, and he showed no sign of chagrin. He used without
fail to inform the new Minister as to the old mode of administration.
What say you of him?"</p>

<p>"That he was a loyal man," said the Master.</p>

<p>"But was he a man of fellow-feeling?" said the disciple.</p>

<p>"Of that I am not sure," he answered; "how am I to get
at that?"</p>

<p>The disciple went on to say:&mdash;"After the assassination
of the prince of Ts&lsquo;i by the officer Ts&lsquo;ui, the latter's fellow-official
Ch&lsquo;in Wan, who had half a score teams of horses,
gave up all, and turned his back upon him. On coming to
another State, he observed, 'There are here characters
somewhat like that of our minister Ts&lsquo;ui,' and he turned his
back upon them. Proceeding to a certain other State, he
had occasion to make the same remark, and left. What say
you of him?"</p>

<p>"That he was a pure-minded man," answered the Master.</p>

<p>"But was he a man of fellow-feeling?" urged the disciple.</p>

<p>"Of that I am not sure," he replied; "how am I to get at
that?"</p>

<p>Ki Wan was one who thought three times over a thing
before he acted. The Master hearing this of him, observed,
"Twice would have been enough."</p>

<p>Of Ning Wu, the Master said that when matters went
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
well in the State he used to have his wits about him: but
when they went wrong, he lost them. His intelligence
might be equalled, but not his witlessness!</p>

<p>Once, when the Master lived in the State of Ch&lsquo;in, he
exclaimed, "Let me get home again! Let me get home! My
school-children<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> are wild and impetuous! Though they are
somewhat accomplished, and perfect in one sense in their
attainments, yet they know not how to make nice discriminations."</p>

<p>Of Peh-I and Shuh Ts&lsquo;i he said, "By the fact of their not
remembering old grievances, they gradually did away
with resentment."</p>

<p>Of Wei-shang Kau he said, "Who calls him straightforward?
A person once begged some vinegar of him, and he
begged it from a neighbor, and then presented him with
it!"</p>

<p>"Fine speech," said he, "and studied mien, and superfluous
show of deference&mdash;of such things Tso-k&lsquo;iu Ming
was ashamed. I too am ashamed of such things. Also of
hiding resentment felt towards an opponent and treating
him as a friend&mdash;of this kind of thing he was ashamed,
and so too am I."</p>

<p>Attended once by the two disciples Yen Yuen and Tsz-lu,
he said, "Come now, why not tell me, each of you, what
in your hearts you are really after?"</p>

<p>"I should like," said Tsz-lu, "for myself and my friends
and associates, carriages and horses, and to be clad in light
furs! nor would I mind much if they should become the
worse for wear."</p>

<p>"And I should like," said Yen Yuen, "to live without
boasting of my abilities, and without display of meritorious
deeds."</p>

<p>Tsz-lu then said, "I should like, sir, to hear what your
heart is set upon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
    The Master replied, "It is this:&mdash;in regard to old people,
to give them quiet and comfort; in regard to friends and
associates, to be faithful to them; in regard to the young,
to treat them with fostering affection and kindness."</p>

<p>On one occasion the Master exclaimed, "Ah, 'tis hopeless!
I have not yet seen the man who can see his errors, so
as inwardly to accuse himself."</p>

<p>"In a small cluster of houses there may well be," said he,
"some whose integrity and sincerity may compare with
mine; but I yield to none in point of love of learning."</p>

<h2>BOOK VI</h2>
<h3><i>More Characteristics&mdash;Wisdom&mdash;Philanthropy</i></h3>

<p>Of Yen Yung, a disciple, the Master said, "Yung might indeed
do for a prince!"</p>

<p>On being asked by this Yen Yung his opinion of a certain
individual, the Master replied, "He is passable. Impetuous,
though."</p>

<p>"But," argued the disciple, "if a man habituate himself
to a reverent regard for duty&mdash;even while in his way of
doing things he is impetuous&mdash;in the oversight of the
people committed to his charge, is he not passable? If, on
the other hand, he habituate himself to impetuosity of
mind, and show it also in his way of doing things, is he not
then over-impetuous?"</p>

<p>"You are right," said the Master.</p>

<p>When the Duke Ngai inquired which of the disciples
were devoted to learning, Confucius answered him, "There
was one Yen HwÃºi who loved it&mdash;a man whose angry feelings
towards any particular person he did not suffer to
visit upon another; a man who would never fall into the
same error twice. Unfortunately his allotted time was
short, and he died, and now his like is not to be found; I
have never heard of one so devoted to learning."</p>

<p>While Tsz-hwa, a disciple, was away on a mission to Ts&lsquo;i,
the disciple Yen Yu, on behalf of his mother, applied for
some grain. "Give her three pecks," said the Master. He
applied for more. "Give her eight, then." Yen gave her
fifty times that amount. The Master said, "When Tsz-hwa
went on that journey to Ts&lsquo;i, he had well-fed steeds yoked
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
to his carriage, and was arrayed in light furs. I have learnt
that the 'superior man' should help those whose needs are
urgent, not help the rich to be more rich."</p>

<p>When Yuen Sz became prefect under him, he gave him
nine hundred measures of grain, but the prefect declined
to accept them.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> "You must not," said the Master. "May
they not be of use to the villages and hamlets around you?"</p>

<p>Speaking of Yen Yung again, the Master said, "If the offspring
of a speckled ox be red in color, and horned, even
though men may not wish to take it for sacrifice, would
the spirits of the hills and streams reject it?"</p>

<p>Adverting to HwÃºi again, he said, "For three months
there would not be in his breast one thought recalcitrant
against his feeling of good-will towards his fellow-men.
The others may attain to this for a day or for a month, but
there they end."</p>

<p>When asked by Ki K&lsquo;ang whether Tsz-lu was fit to serve
the government, the Master replied, "Tsz-lu is a man of
decision: what should prevent him from serving the government?"</p>

<p>Asked the same question respecting Tsz-kung and Yen
Yu he answered similarly, pronouncing Tsz-kung to be a
man of perspicacity, and Yen Yu to be one versed in the
polite arts.</p>

<p>When the head of the Ki family sent for Min Tsz-k&lsquo;ien to
make him governor of the town of Pi, that disciple said,
"Politely decline for me. If the offer is renewed, then indeed
I shall feel myself obliged to go and live on the further
bank of the Wan."</p>

<p>Peh-niu had fallen ill, and the Master was inquiring
after him. Taking hold of his hand held out from the window,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
he said, "It is taking him off! Alas, his appointed time
has come! Such a man, and to have such an illness!"</p>

<p>Of HwÃºi, again: "A right worthy man indeed was he!
With his simple wooden dish of rice, and his one gourd-basin
of drink, away in his poor back lane, in a condition
too grievous for others to have endured, he never allowed
his cheery spirits to droop. Aye, a right worthy soul was
he!"</p>

<p>"It is not," Yen Yu once apologized, "that I do not take
pleasure in your doctrines; it is that I am not strong
enough." The Master rejoined, "It is when those who are
not strong enough have made some moderate amount of
progress that they fail and give up; but you are now drawing
your own line for yourself."</p>

<p>Addressing Tsz-hiÃ¡, the Master said, "Let your scholarship
be that of gentlemen, and not like that of common
men."</p>

<p>When Tsz-yu became governor of Wu-shing, the Master
said to him, "Do you find good men about you?" The reply
was, "There is Tan-t&lsquo;ai Mieh-ming, who when walking eschews
by-paths, and who, unless there be some public
function, never approaches my private residence."</p>

<p>"Mang Chi-fan," said the Master, "is no sounder of his
own praises. During a stampede he was in the rear, and as
they were about to enter the city gate he whipped up his
horses, and said, ''Twas not my daring made me lag behind.
My horses would not go.'"</p>

<p><i>Obiter dicta</i> of the Master:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whoever has not the glib utterance of the priest T&lsquo;o, as
well as the handsomeness of Prince ChÃ¡u of Sung, will find
it hard to keep out of harm's way in the present age.</p>

<p>"Who can go out but by that door? Why walks no one
by these guiding principles?</p>

<p>"Where plain naturalness is more in evidence than
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
polish, we have&mdash;the man from the country. Where polish
is more in evidence than naturalness, we have&mdash;the town
scribe. It is when naturalness and polish are equally evident
that we have the ideal man.</p>

<p>"The life of a man is&mdash;his rectitude. Life without it&mdash;such
may you have the good fortune to avoid!</p>

<p>"They who know it are not as those who love it, nor they
who love it as those who rejoice in it&mdash;that is, have the
fruition of their love for it.</p>

<p>"To the average man, and those above the average, it is
possible to discourse on higher subjects; to those from the
average downwards, it is not possible."</p>

<p>Fan Ch&lsquo;i put a query about wisdom. The Master replied,
"To labor for the promoting of righteous conduct among
the people of the land; to be serious in regard to spiritual
beings, and to hold aloof from them;&mdash;this may be called
wisdom."</p>

<p>To a further query, about philanthropy, he replied,
"Those who possess that virtue find difficulty with it at
first, success later.</p>

<p>"Men of practical knowledge," he said, "find their gratification
among the rivers of the lowland, men of sympathetic
social feeling find theirs among the hills. The former
are active and bustling, the latter calm and quiet. The
former take their day of pleasure, the latter look to length
of days."</p>

<p>Alluding to the States of Ts&lsquo;i and Lu, he observed, that
Ts&lsquo;i, by one change, might attain to the condition of Lu;
and that Lu, by one change, might attain to good government.</p>

<p>An exclamation of the Master (satirizing the times, when
old terms relating to government were still used while
bereft of their old meaning):&mdash;"A quart, and not a quart!
<i>quart</i>, indeed! <i>quart</i>, indeed!"</p>

<p>Tsai Wo, a disciple, put a query. Said he, "Suppose a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
philanthropic person were told, 'There's a fellow-creature
down in the well!' Would he go down after him?"</p>

<p>"Why should he really do so?" answered the Master.
"The good man, or a superior man might be induced to go,
but not to go down. He may be misled, but not befooled."</p>

<p>"The superior man," said he, "with his wide study of
books, and hedging himself round by the Rules of Propriety,
is not surely, after all that, capable of overstepping his
bounds."</p>

<p>Once when the Master had had an interview with
Nan-tsz, which had scandalized his disciple Tsz-lu, he uttered
the solemn adjuration, "If I have done aught amiss,
may Heaven reject me! may Heaven reject me!"</p>

<p>"How far-reaching," said he, "is the moral excellence
that flows from the Constant Mean!<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It has for a long time
been rare among the people."</p>

<p>Tsz-kung said, "Suppose the case of one who confers
benefits far and wide upon the people, and who can, in so
doing, make his bounty universally felt&mdash;how would you
speak of him? Might he be called philanthropic?"</p>

<p>The Master exclaimed, "What a work for philanthropy!
He would require indeed to be a sage! He would put into
shade even Yau and Shun!&mdash;Well, a philanthropic person,
desiring for himself a firm footing, is led on to give one to
others; desiring for himself an enlightened perception of
things, he is led on to help others to be similarly enlightened.
If one could take an illustration coming closer home
to us than yours, that might be made the starting-point for
speaking about philanthropy."</p>

<h2>BOOK VII</h2>
<h3><i>Characteristics of Confucius&mdash;An Incident</i></h3>

<p>Said the Master:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I, as a transmitter<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and not an originator, and as one
who believes in and loves the ancients, venture to compare
myself with our old P&lsquo;ang.</p>

<p>"What find you indeed in me?&mdash;a quiet brooder and
memorizer; a student never satiated with learning; an unwearied
monitor of others!</p>

<p>"The things which weigh heavily upon my mind are
these&mdash;failure to improve in the virtues, failure in discussion
of what is learnt, inability to walk according to knowledge
received as to what is right and just, inability also to
reform what has been amiss."</p>

<p>In his hours of recreation and refreshment the Master's
manner was easy and unconstrained, affable and winning.</p>

<p>Once he exclaimed, "Alas! I must be getting very feeble;
'tis long since I have had a repetition of the dreams in
which I used to see the Duke of Chow.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>"Concentrate the mind," said he, "upon the Good Way.</p>

<p>"Maintain firm hold upon Virtue.</p>

<p>"Rely upon Philanthropy.</p>

<p>"Find recreation in the Arts.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
    "I have never withheld instruction from any, even from
those who have come for it with the smallest offering.</p>

<p>"No subject do I broach, however, to those who have no
eager desire to learn; no encouraging hint do I give to
those who show no anxiety to speak out their ideas; nor
have I anything more to say to those who, after I have
made clear one corner of the subject, cannot from that give
me the other three."</p>

<p>If the Master was taking a meal, and there were any in
mourning beside him, he would not eat to the full.</p>

<p>On one day on which he had wept, on that day he would
not sing.</p>

<p>Addressing his favorite disciple, he said, "To you only
and myself it has been given to do this&mdash;to go when called
to serve, and to go back into quiet retirement when released
from office."</p>

<p>Tsz-lu, hearing the remark said, "But if, sir, you had the
handling of the army of one of the greater States,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> whom
would you have associated with you in that case?"</p>

<p>The Master answered:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Not the one 'who'll rouse the tiger,'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not the one 'who'll wade the Ho;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>not the man who can die with no regret. He must be one
who should watch over affairs with apprehensive caution,
a man fond of strategy, and of perfect skill and effectiveness
in it."</p>

<p>As to wealth, he remarked, "If wealth were an object
that I could go in quest of, I should do so even if I had to
take a whip and do grooms' work. But seeing that it is not,
I go after those objects for which I have a liking."</p>

<p>Among matters over which he exercised great caution
were times of fasting, war, and sickness.</p>

<p>When he was in the State of Ts&lsquo;i, and had heard the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
ancient Shau music, he lost all perception of the taste of
his meat. "I had no idea," said he, "that music could have
been brought to this pitch."</p>

<p>In the course of conversation Yen Yu said, "Does the
Master take the part of the Prince of Wei?" "Ah yes!" said
Tsz-kung, "I will go and ask him that."</p>

<p>On going in to him, that disciple began, "What sort of
men were Peh-I and Shuh Ts&lsquo;i?" "Worthies of the olden
time," the Master replied. "Had they any feelings of resentment?"
was the next question. "Their aim and object,"
he answered, "was that of doing the duty which every man
owes to his fellows, and they succeeded in doing it;&mdash;what
room further for feelings of resentment?" The questioner
on coming out said, "The Master does not take his part."</p>

<p>"With a meal of coarse rice," said the Master, "and with
water to drink, and my bent arm for my pillow&mdash;even thus
I can find happiness. Riches and honors without righteousness
are to me as fleeting clouds."</p>

<p>"Give me several years more to live," said he, "and after
fifty years' study of the 'Book of Changes' I might come to
be free from serious error."</p>

<p>The Master's regular subjects of discourse were the
"Books of the Odes" and "History," and the up-keeping of
the Rules of Propriety. On all of these he regularly discoursed.</p>

<p>The Duke of Shih questioned Tsz-lu about Confucius,
and the latter did not answer.</p>

<p>Hearing of this, the Master said, "Why did you not say,
He is a man with a mind so intent on his pursuits that he
forgets his food, and finds such pleasure in them that he
forgets his troubles, and does not know that old age is
coming upon him?"</p>

<p>"As I came not into life with any knowledge of it," he
said, "and as my likings are for what is old, I busy myself
in seeking knowledge there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
    Strange occurrences, exploits of strength, deeds of lawlessness,
references to spiritual beings&mdash;such-like matters
the Master avoided in conversation.</p>

<p>"Let there," he said, "be three men walking together:
from that number I should be sure to find my instructors;
for what is good in them I should choose out and follow,
and what is not good I should modify."</p>

<p>On one occasion he exclaimed, "Heaven begat Virtue in
me; what can man do unto me?"</p>

<p>To his disciples he once said, "Do you look upon me, my
sons, as keeping anything secret from you? I hide nothing
from you. I do nothing that is not manifest to your eyes,
my disciples. That is so with me."</p>

<p>Four things there were which he kept in view in his
teaching&mdash;scholarliness, conduct of life, honesty, faithfulness.</p>

<p>"It is not given to me," he said, "to meet with a sage; let
me but behold a man of superior mind, and that will suffice.
Neither is it given to me to meet with a good man; let
me but see a man of constancy, and it will suffice. It is difficult
for persons to have constancy, when they pretend to
have that which they are destitute of, to be full when they
are empty, to do things on a grand scale when their means
are contracted!"</p>

<p>When the Master fished with hook and line, he did not
also use a net. When out with his bow, he would never
shoot at game in cover.</p>

<p>"Some there may be," said he, "who do things in ignorance
of what they do. I am not of these. There is an
alternative way of knowing things, viz.&mdash;to sift out the
good from the many things one hears, and follow it; and to
keep in memory the many things one sees."</p>

<p>Pupils from Hu-hiang were difficult to speak with. One
youth came to interview the Master, and the disciples
were in doubt whether he ought to have been seen. "Why
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
so much ado," said the Master, "at my merely permitting
his approach, and not rather at my allowing him to draw
back? If a man have cleansed himself in order to come and
see me, I receive him as such; but I do not undertake for
what he will do when he goes away."</p>

<p>"Is the philanthropic spirit far to seek, indeed?" the
Master exclaimed; "I wish for it, and it is with me!"</p>

<p>The Minister of Crime in the State of Ch&lsquo;in asked Confucius
whether Duke Ch&lsquo;au, of Lu was acquainted with
the Proprieties; and he answered, "Yes, he knows them."</p>

<p>When Confucius had withdrawn, the minister bowed to
Wu-ma K&lsquo;i, a disciple, and motioned to him to come forward.
He said, "I have heard that superior men show no
partiality; are they, too, then, partial? That prince took for
his wife a lady of the Wu family, having the same surname
as himself, and had her named 'Lady Tsz of Wu, the elder.'
If he knows the Proprieties, then who does not?"</p>

<p>The disciple reported this to the Master, who thereupon
remarked, "Well for me! If I err in any way, others are
sure to know of it."</p>

<p>When the Master was in company with any one who
sang, and who sang well, he must needs have the song over
again, and after that would join in it.</p>

<p>"Although in letters," he said, "I may have none to compare
with me, yet in my personification of the 'superior
man' I have not as yet been successful."</p>

<p>"'A Sage and a Philanthropist?' How should I have the
ambition?" said he. "All that I can well be called is this&mdash;An
insatiable student, an unwearied teacher;&mdash;this, and no
more."&mdash;"Exactly what we, your disciples, cannot by any
learning manage to be," said Kung-si Hwa.</p>

<p>Once when the Master was seriously ill, Tsz-lu requested
to be allowed to say prayers for him. "Are such available?"
asked the Master. "Yes," said he; "and the Manual of Prayers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
says, 'Pray to the spirits above and to those here below.'"</p>

<p>"My praying has been going on a long while," said the
Master.</p>

<p>"Lavish living," he said, "renders men disorderly; miserliness
makes them hard. Better, however, the hard than the
disorderly."</p>

<p>Again, "The man of superior mind is placidly composed;
the small-minded man is in a constant state of perturbation."</p>

<p>The Master was gentle, yet could be severe; had an overawing
presence, yet was not violent; was deferential, yet
easy.</p>

<h2>BOOK VIII</h2>
<h3><i>Sayings of Tsang&mdash;Sentences of the Master</i></h3>

<p>Speaking of T&lsquo;ai-pih the Master said that he might be pronounced
a man of the highest moral excellence; for he allowed
the empire to pass by him onwards to a third heir;
while the people, in their ignorance of his motives, were
unable to admire him for so doing.</p>

<p>"Without the Proprieties," said the Master, "we have
these results: for deferential demeanor, a worried one; for
calm attentiveness, awkward bashfulness; for manly conduct,
disorderliness; for straightforwardness, perversity.</p>

<p>"When men of rank show genuine care for those nearest
to them in blood, the people rise to the duty of neighborliness
and sociability. And when old friendships among
them are not allowed to fall off, there will be a cessation of
underhand practices among the people."</p>

<p>The Scholar Tsang was once unwell, and calling his pupils
to him he said to them, "Disclose to view my feet and
my hands. What says the Ode?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Act as from a sense of danger,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With precaution and with care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a yawning gulf o'erlooking,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As on ice that scarce will bear.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At all times, my children, I know how to keep myself free
from bodily harm."</p>

<p>Again, during an illness of his, Mang King, an official,
went to ask after him. The Scholar had some conversation
with him, in the course of which he said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">"'Doleful the cries of a dying bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Good the last words of a dying man.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are three points which a man of rank in the management
of his duties should set store upon:&mdash;A lively manner
and deportment, banishing both severity and laxity; a
frank and open expression of countenance, allied closely
with sincerity; and a tone in his utterances utterly free
from any approach to vulgarity and impropriety. As to
matters of bowls and dishes, leave such things to those
who are charged with the care of them."</p>

<p>Another saying of the Scholar Tsang: "I once had a
friend who, though he possessed ability, would go questioning
men of none, and though surrounded by numbers,
would go with his questions to isolated individuals; who
also, whatever he might have, appeared as if he were without
it, and, with all his substantial acquirements, made as
though his mind were a mere blank; and when insulted
would not retaliate;&mdash;this was ever his way."</p>

<p>Again he said: "The man that is capable of being intrusted
with the charge of a minor on the throne, and
given authority over a large territory, and who, during the
important term of his superintendence cannot be forced
out of his position, is not such a 'superior man'? That he is,
indeed."</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;"The learned official must not be without
breadth and power of endurance: the burden is heavy,
and the way is long.</p>

<p>"Suppose that he take his duty to his fellow-men as his
peculiar burden, is that not indeed a heavy one? And since
only with death it is done with, is not the way long?"</p>

<p>Sentences of the Master:&mdash;</p>

<p>"From the 'Book of Odes' we receive impulses; from the
'Book of the Rules,' stability; from the 'Book on Music,'
refinement.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
    "The people may be put into the way they should go,
though they may not be put into the way of understanding
it.</p>

<p>"The man who likes bravery, and yet groans under poverty,
has mischief in him. So, too, has the misanthrope,
groaning at any severity shown towards him.</p>

<p>"Even if a person were adorned with the gifts of the
Duke of Chow, yet if he were proud and avaricious, all the
rest of his qualities would not indeed be worth looking at.</p>

<p>"Not easily found is the man who, after three years'
study, has failed to come upon some fruit of his toil.</p>

<p>"The really faithful lover of learning holds fast to the
Good Way till death.</p>

<p>"He will not go into a State in which a downfall is imminent,
nor take up his abode in one where disorder
reigns. When the empire is well ordered he will show himself;
when not, he will hide himself away. Under a good
government it will be a disgrace to him if he remain in
poverty and low estate; under a bad one, it would be
equally disgraceful to him to hold riches and honors.</p>

<p>"If not occupying the office, devise not the policy.</p>

<p>"When the professor Chi began his duties, how grand
the finale of the First of the Odes used to be! How it rang
in one's ears!</p>

<p>"I cannot understand persons who are enthusiastic and
yet not straightforward; nor those who are ignorant and
yet not attentive; nor again those folks who are simple-minded
and yet untrue.</p>

<p>"Learn, as if never overtaking your object, and yet as if
apprehensive of losing it.</p>

<p>"How sublime was the handling of the empire by Shun
and Yu!&mdash;it was as nothing to them!</p>

<p>"How great was Yau as a prince! Was he not sublime!
Say that Heaven only is great, then was Yau alone after its
pattern! How profound was he! The people could not find
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
a name for him. How sublime in his achievements! How
brilliant in his scholarly productions!"</p>

<p>Shun had for his ministers five men, by whom he ordered
the empire.</p>

<p>King Wu (in his day) stated that he had ten men as assistants
for the promotion of order.</p>

<p>With reference to these facts Confucius observed, "Ability
is hard to find. Is it not so indeed? During the three
years' interregnum between Yau and Shun there was more
of it than in the interval before this present dynasty appeared.
There were, at this latter period, one woman, and
nine men only.</p>

<p>"When two-thirds of the empire were held by King
Wan, he served with that portion the House of Yin. We
speak of the virtue of the House of Chow; we may say, indeed,
that it reached the pinnacle of excellence."</p>

<p>"As to Yu," added the Master, "I can find no flaw in him.
Living on meagre food and drink; yet providing to the utmost
in his filial offerings to the spirits of the dead! Dressing
in coarse garments; yet most elegant when vested in
his sacrificial apron and coronet! Dwelling in a poor palace;
yet exhausting his energies over those boundary-ditches
and watercourses! I can find no flaw in Yu."</p>

<h2>BOOK IX</h2>
<h3><i>His Favorite Disciple's Opinion of Him</i></h3>

<p>Topics on which the Master rarely spoke were&mdash;Advantage,
and Destiny, and Duty of man to man.</p>

<p>A man of the village of Tah-hiang exclaimed of him, "A
great man is Confucius!&mdash;a man of extensive learning, and
yet in nothing has he quite made himself a name!"</p>

<p>The Master heard of this, and mentioning it to his disciples
he said, "What then shall I take in hand? Shall I
become a carriage driver, or an archer? Let me be a
driver!"</p>

<p>"The sacrificial cap," he once said, "should, according to
the Rules, be of linen; but in these days it is of pure silk.
However, as it is economical, I do as all do.</p>

<p>"The Rule says, 'Make your bow when at the lower end
of the hall'; but nowadays the bowing is done at the upper
part. This is great freedom; and I, though I go in opposition
to the crowd, bow when at the lower end."</p>

<p>The Master barred four words:&mdash;he would have no
"shall's", no "must's", no "certainly's", no "I's."</p>

<p>Once, in the town of K&lsquo;wang fearing that his life was
going to be taken, the Master exclaimed, "King Wan is
dead and gone; but is not '<i>wan</i>'<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> with you here? If Heaven
be about to allow this '<i>wan</i>' to perish, then they who survive
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
its decease will get no benefit from it. But so long as
Heaven does not allow it to perish, what can the men of
K&lsquo;wang do to me?"</p>

<p>A high State official, after questioning Tsz-kung, said,
"Your Master is a sage, then? How many and what varied
abilities must be his!"</p>

<p>The disciple replied, "Certainly Heaven is allowing him
full opportunities of becoming a sage, in addition to the
fact that his abilities are many and varied."</p>

<p>When the Master heard of this he remarked, "Does that
high official know me? In my early years my position in
life was low, and hence my ability in many ways, though
exercised in trifling matters. In the gentleman is there
indeed such variety of ability? No."</p>

<p>From this, the disciple Lau used to say, "'Twas a saying
of the Master: 'At a time when I was not called upon
to use them, I acquired my proficiency in the polite arts.'"</p>

<p>"Am I, indeed," said the Master, "possessed of knowledge?
I know nothing. Let a vulgar fellow come to me
with a question&mdash;a man with an emptyish head&mdash;I may
thrash out with him the matter from end to end, and exhaust
myself in doing it!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed he once, "the ph&oelig;nix does not come!
and no symbols issue from the river! May I not as well
give up?"</p>

<p>Whenever the Master met with a person in mourning,
or with one in full-dress cap and kirtle, or with a blind
person, although they might be young persons, he would
make a point of rising on their appearance, or, if crossing
their path, would do so with quickened step!</p>

<p>Once Yen Yuen exclaimed with a sigh (with reference
to the Master's doctrines), "If I look up to them, they are
ever the higher; if I try to penetrate them, they are ever
the harder; if I gaze at them as if before my eyes, lo, they
are behind me!&mdash;Gradually and gently the Master with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
skill lures men on. By literary lore he gave me breadth;
by the Rules of Propriety he narrowed me down. When I
desire a respite, I find it impossible; and after I have exhausted
my powers, there seems to be something standing
straight up in front of me, and though I have the mind
to make towards it I make no advance at all."</p>

<p>Once when the Master was seriously ill, Tsz-lu induced
the other disciples to feign they were high officials acting
in his service. During a respite from his malady the Master
exclaimed, "Ah! how long has Tsz-lu's conduct been
false? Whom should I delude, if I were to pretend to have
officials under me, having none? Should I deceive Heaven?
Besides, were I to die, I would rather die in the hands of
yourselves, my disciples, than in the hands of officials.
And though I should fail to have a grand funeral over me,
I should hardly be left on my death on the public highway,
should I?"</p>

<p>Tsz-kung <a name="once" id="once"></a>once said to him, "Here is a fine gem. Would
you guard it carefully in a casket and store it away, or
seek a good price for it and sell it?" "Sell it, indeed," said
the Master&mdash;"that would I; but I should wait for the
bidder."</p>

<p>The Master protested he would "go and live among the
nine wild tribes."</p>

<p>"A rude life," said some one;&mdash;"how could you put up
with it?"</p>

<p>"What rudeness would there be," he replied, "if a 'superior
man' was living in their midst?"</p>

<p>Once he remarked, "After I came back from Wei to Lu
the music was put right, and each of the Festal Odes and
Hymns was given its appropriate place and use."</p>

<p>"Ah! which one of these following," he asked on one
occasion, "are to be found exemplified in me&mdash;proper
service rendered to superiors when abroad; duty to father
and elder brother when at home; duty that shrinks from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
no exertion when dear ones die; and keeping free from
the confusing effects of wine?"</p>

<p>Standing once on the bank of a mountain stream, he
said (musingly), "Like this are those that pass away&mdash;no
cessation, day or night!"</p>

<p>Other sayings:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take an illustration from the making of a hill. A simple
basketful is wanting to complete it, and the work stops.
So I stop short.</p>

<p>"Take an illustration from the levelling of the ground.
Suppose again just one basketful is left, when the work
has so progressed. There I desist!</p>

<p>"Ah! it was HwÃºi, was it not? who, when I had given
him his lesson, was the unflagging one!</p>

<p>"Alas for HwÃºi! I saw him ever making progress. I never
saw him stopping short.</p>

<p>"Blade, but no bloom&mdash;or else bloom, but no produce;
aye, that is the way with some!</p>

<p>"Reverent regard is due to youth. How know we what
difference there may be in them in the future from what
they are now? Yet when they have reached the age of
forty or fifty, and are still unknown in the world, then
indeed they are no more worthy of such regard.</p>

<p>"Can any do otherwise than assent to words said to
them by way of correction? Only let them reform by such
advice, and it will then be reckoned valuable. Can any be
other than pleased with words of gentle suasion? Only let
them comply with them fully, and such also will be accounted
valuable. With those who are pleased without so
complying, and those who assent but do not reform, I can
do nothing at all.</p>

<p>"Give prominent place to loyalty and sincerity.</p>

<p>"Have no associates in study who are not advanced
somewhat like yourself.</p>

<p>"When you have erred, be not afraid to correct yourself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
    "It may be possible to seize and carry off the chief commander
of a large army, but not possible so to rob one poor
fellow of his will.</p>

<p>"One who stands&mdash;clad in hempen robe, the worse for
wear&mdash;among others clad in furs of fox and badger, and
yet unabashed&mdash;'tis Tsz-lu, that, is it not?"</p>

<p>Tsz-lu used always to be humming over the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From envy and enmity free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What deed doth he other than good?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"How should such a rule of life," asked the Master, "be
sufficient to make any one good?"</p>

<p>"When the year grows chilly, we know the pine and
cypress are the last to fade.</p>

<p>"The wise escape doubt; the good-hearted, trouble; the
bold, apprehension.</p>

<p>"Some may study side by side, and yet be asunder when
they come to the logic of things. Some may go on together
in this latter course, but be wide apart in the standards
they reach in it. Some, again, may together reach the same
standard, and yet be diverse in weight of character."</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The blossom is out on the cherry tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a flutter on every spray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost think that my thoughts go not out to thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ah, why art thou far away!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Commenting on these lines the Master said, "There can
hardly have been much thought going out. What does
distance signify?"</p>

    "Wan" was the honorary appellation of the great sage and ruler, whose
praise is in the "Shi-King" as one of the founders of the Chow dynasty,
and the term represented civic talent and virtues, as distinct from Wu, the
martial talent&mdash;the latter being the honorary title of his son and successor.
"Wan" also often stands for literature, and polite accomplishments. Here
Confucius simply means, "If you kill me, you kill a sage."</p>

<h2>BOOK X</h2>
<h3><i>Confucius in Private and Official Life</i></h3>

<p>In his own village, Confucius presented a somewhat plain
and simple appearance, and looked unlike a man who
possessed ability of speech.</p>

<p>But in the ancestral temple, and at Court, he spoke with
the fluency and accuracy of a debater, but ever guardedly.</p>

<p>At Court, conversing with the lower order of great officials,
he spoke somewhat firmly and directly; with those
of the higher order his tone was somewhat more affable.</p>

<p>When the prince was present he was constrainedly
reverent in his movements, and showed a proper degree
of grave dignity in demeanor.</p>

<p>Whenever the prince summoned him to act as usher to
the Court, his look would change somewhat, and he would
make as though he were turning round to do obeisance.</p>

<p>He would salute those among whom he took up his position,
using the right hand or the left, and holding the
skirts of his robe in proper position before and behind.
He would make his approaches with quick step, and with
elbows evenly bent outwards.</p>

<p>When the visitor withdrew, he would not fail to report
the execution of his commands, with the words, "The visitor
no longer looks back."</p>

<p>When he entered the palace gate, it was with the body
somewhat bent forward, almost as though he could not
be admitted. When he stood still, this would never happen
in the middle of the gateway; nor when moving about
would he ever tread on the threshold. When passing the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
throne, his look would change somewhat, he would turn
aside and make a sort of obeisance, and the words he
spoke seemed as though he were deficient in utterance.</p>

<p>On going up the steps to the audience chamber, he
would gather up with both hands the ends of his robe,
and walk with his body bent somewhat forward, holding
back his breath like one in whom respiration has ceased.
On coming out, after descending one step his countenance
would relax and assume an appearance of satisfaction.
Arrived at the bottom, he would go forward with
quick step, his elbows evenly bent outwards, back to his
position, constrainedly reverent in every movement.</p>

<p>When holding the sceptre in his hand, his body would
be somewhat bent forward, as if he were not equal to
carrying it; wielding it now higher, as in a salutation,
now lower, as in the presentation of a gift; his look would
also be changed and appear awestruck; and his gait would
seem retarded, as if he were obeying some restraining
hand behind.</p>

<p>When he presented the gifts of ceremony, he would
assume a placid expression of countenance. At the private
interview he would be cordial and affable.</p>

<p>The good man would use no purple or violet colors for
the facings of his dress.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Nor would he have red or orange
color for his undress.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> For the hot season he wore a singlet,
of either coarse or fine texture, but would also feel bound
to have an outer garment covering it. For his black robe
he had lamb's wool; for his white one, fawn's fur; and for
his yellow one, fox fur. His furred undress robe was
longer, but the right sleeve was shortened. He would
needs have his sleeping-dress one and a half times his own
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
length. For ordinary home wear he used thick substantial
fox or badger furs. When he left off mourning, he would
wear all his girdle trinkets. His kirtle in front, when it was
not needed for full cover, he must needs have cut down.
He would never wear his (black) lamb's-wool, or a dark-colored
cap, when he went on visits of condolence to
mourners.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> On the first day of the new moon, he must
have on his Court dress and to Court. When observing
his fasts, he made a point of having bright, shiny garments,
made of linen. He must also at such times vary his
food, and move his seat to another part of his dwelling-room.</p>

<p>As to his food, he never tired of rice so long as it was
clean and pure, nor of hashed meats when finely minced.
Rice spoiled by damp, and sour, he would not touch, nor
tainted fish, nor bad meat, nor aught of a bad color or
smell, nor aught overdone in cooking, nor aught out of
season. Neither would he eat anything that was not properly
cut, or that lacked its proper seasonings. Although
there might be an abundance of meat before him, he
would not allow a preponderance of it to rob the rice of
its beneficial effect in nutrition. Only in the matter of
wine did he set himself no limit, yet he never drank so
much as to confuse himself. Tradesmen's wines, and dried
meats from the market, he would not touch. Ginger he
would never have removed from the table during a meal.
He was not a great eater. Meat from the sacrifices at the
prince's temple he would never put aside till the following
day. The meat of his own offerings he would never give
out after three days' keeping, for after that time none were
to eat it.</p>

<p>At his meals he would not enter into discussions; and
when reposing (afterwards) he would not utter a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
    Even should his meal consist only of coarse rice and
vegetable broth or melons, he would make an offering,
and never fail to do so religiously.</p>

<p>He would never sit on a mat that was not straight.</p>

<p>After a feast among his villagers, he would wait before
going away until the old men had left.</p>

<p>When the village people were exorcising the pests, he
would put on his Court robes and stand on the steps of his
hall to receive them.</p>

<p>When he was sending a message of inquiry to a person
in another State, he would bow twice on seeing the messenger
off.</p>

<p>Ki K&lsquo;ang once sent him a present of some medicine. He
bowed, and received it; but remarked, "Until I am quite
sure of its properties I must not venture to taste it."</p>

<p>Once when the stabling was destroyed by fire, he withdrew
from the Court, and asked, "Is any person injured?"&mdash;without
inquiring as to the horses.</p>

<p>Whenever the prince sent him a present of food, he was
particular to set his mat in proper order, and would be the
first one to taste it. If the prince's present was one of raw
meat, he must needs have it cooked, and make an oblation
of it. If the gift were a live animal, he would be sure to
keep it and care for it.</p>

<p>When he was in waiting, and at a meal with the prince,
the prince would make the offering,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and he (the Master)
was the pregustator.</p>

<p>When unwell, and the prince came to see him, he would
arrange his position so that his head inclined towards the
east, would put over him his Court robes, and draw his
girdle across them.</p>

<p>When summoned by order of the prince, he would start
off without waiting for his horses to be put to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
    On his entry into the Grand Temple, he inquired about
everything connected with its usages.</p>

<p>If a friend died, and there were no near relatives to take
him to, he would say, "Let him be buried from my house."</p>

<p>For a friend's gift&mdash;unless it consisted of meat that had
been offered in sacrifice&mdash;he would not bow, even if it
were a carriage and horses.</p>

<p>In repose he did not lie like one dead. In his home life
he was not formal in his manner.</p>

<p>Whenever he met with a person in mourning, even
though it were a familiar acquaintance, he would be certain
to change his manner; and when he met with any
one in full-dress cap, or with any blind person, he would
also unfailingly put on a different look, even though he
were himself in undress at the time.</p>

<p>In saluting any person wearing mourning he would
bow forwards towards the front bar of his carriage; in
the same manner he would also salute the bearer of a
census-register.</p>

<p>When a sumptuous banquet was spread before him, a
different expression would be sure to appear in his features,
and he would rise up from his seat.</p>

<p>At a sudden thunder-clap, or when the wind grew
furious, his look would also invariably be changed.</p>

<p>On getting into his car, he would never fail (first) to
stand up erect, holding on by the strap. When in the car,
he would never look about, nor speak hastily, nor bring
one hand to the other.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let one but make a movement in his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bird will rise and seek some safer place."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Apropos of this, he said, "Here is a hen-pheasant from
Shan Liang&mdash;and in season! and in season!" After Tsz-lu
had got it prepared, he smelt it thrice, and then rose up
from his seat.</p>

<h2>BOOK XI</h2>
<h3><i>Comparative Worth of His Disciples</i></h3>

<p>"The first to make progress in the Proprieties and in
Music," said the Master, "are plain countrymen; after
them, the men of higher standing. If I had to employ
any of them, I should stand by the former."</p>

<p>"Of those," said he, "who were about me when I was
in the Ch&lsquo;in and Ts&lsquo;ai States, not one now is left to approach
my door."</p>

<p>"As for HwÃºi,"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> said the Master, "he is not one to help
me on: there is nothing I say but he is not well satisfied
with."</p>

<p>"What a dutiful son was Min Tsz-k&lsquo;ien!" he exclaimed.
"No one finds occasion to differ from what his parents
and brothers have said of him."</p>

<p>Nan Yung used to repeat three times over the lines in
the Odes about the white sceptre. Confucius caused his
own elder brother's daughter to be given in marriage to
him.</p>

<p>When Ki K&lsquo;ang inquired which of the disciples were
fond of learning, Confucius answered him, "There was one
Yen HwÃºi who was fond of it; but unfortunately his allotted
time was short, and he died; and now his like is not
to be found."</p>

<p>When Yen Yuen died, his father, Yen Lu, begged for the
Master's carriage in order to get a shell for his coffin.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
"Ability or no ability," said the Master, "every father still
speaks of 'my son.' When my own son Li died, and the
coffin for him had no shell to it, I know I did not go on
foot to get him one; but that was because I was, though
retired, in the wake of the ministers, and could not therefore
well do so."</p>

<p>On the death of Yen Yuen the Master exclaimed, "Ah
me! Heaven is ruining me, Heaven is ruining me!"</p>

<p>On the same occasion, his wailing for that disciple becoming
excessive, those who were about him said, "Sir,
this is too much!"&mdash;"Too much?" said he; "if I am not to
do so for him, then&mdash;for whom else?"</p>

<p>The disciples then wished for the deceased a grand
funeral. The Master could not on his part consent to this.
They nevertheless gave him one. Upon this he remarked,
"He used to look upon me as if I were his father. I could
never, however, look on him as a son. 'Twas not my mistake,
but yours, my children."</p>

<p>Tsz-lu propounded a question about ministering to the
spirits of the departed. The Master replied, "Where there
is scarcely the ability to minister to living men, how shall
there be ability to minister to the spirits?" On his venturing
to put a question concerning death, he answered,
"Where there is scarcely any knowledge about life, how
shall there be any about death?"</p>

<p>The disciple Min was by his side, looking affable and
bland; Tsz-lu also, looking careless and intrepid; and Yen
Yu and Tsz-kung, firm and precise. The Master was
cheery. "One like Tsz-lu there," said he, "does not come
to a natural end."</p>

<p>Some persons in Lu were taking measures in regard to
the Long Treasury House. Min Tsz-k&lsquo;ien observed, "How
if it were repaired on the old lines?" The Master upon this
remarked, "This fellow is not a talker, but when he does
speak he is bound to hit the mark!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
    "There is Yu's harpsichord," exclaimed the Master&mdash;"what
is it doing at my door?" On seeing, however, some
disrespect shown to him by the other disciples, he added,
"Yu has got as far as the top of the hall; only he has not
yet entered the house."</p>

<p>Tsz-kung asked which was the worthier of the two&mdash;Tsz-chang
or Tsz-hiÃ¡. "The former," answered the Master,
"goes beyond the mark; the latter falls short of it."</p>

<p>"So then Tsz-chang is the better of the two, is he?" said
he.</p>

<p>"To go too far," he replied, "is about the same as to fall
short."</p>

<p>The Chief of the Ki family was a wealthier man than
the Duke of Chow had been, and yet Yen Yu gathered
and hoarded for him, increasing his wealth more and more.</p>

<p>"He is no follower of mine," said the Master. "It would
serve him right, my children, to sound the drum, and set
upon him."</p>

<p>Characteristics of four disciples:&mdash;Tsz-kÃ¡u was simple-minded;
Tsang Si, a dullard; Tsz-chang, full of airs; Tsz-lu,
rough.</p>

<p>"As to HwÃºi," said the Master, "he comes near to perfection,
while frequently in great want. Tsz-kung does not
submit to the appointments of Heaven; and yet his goods
are increased;&mdash;he is often successful in his calculations."</p>

<p>Tsz-chang wanted to know some marks of the naturally
Good Man.</p>

<p>"He does not walk in others' footprints," said the Master;
"yet he does not get beyond the hall into the house."</p>

<p>Once the Master said, "Because we allow that a man's
words have something genuine in them, are they necessarily
those of a superior man? or words carrying only an
outward semblance and show of gravity?"</p>

<p>Tsz-lu put a question about the practice of precepts one
has heard. The Master's reply was, "In a case where there
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
is a father or elder brother still left with you, how should
you practise all you hear?"</p>

<p>When, however, the same question was put to him by
Yen Yu, his reply was, "Yes; do so."</p>

<p>Kung-si Hwa animadverted upon this to the Master.
"Tsz-lu asked you, sir," said he, "about the practice of
what one has learnt, and you said, 'There may be a father
or elder brother still alive'; but when Yen Yu asked the
same question, you answered, 'Yes, do so.' I am at a loss
to understand you, and venture to ask what you meant."</p>

<p>The Master replied, "Yen Yu backs out of his duties;
therefore I push him on. Tsz-lu has forwardness enough
for them both; therefore I hold him back."</p>

<p>On the occasion of that time of fear in K&lsquo;wang, Yen
Yuen having fallen behind, the Master said to him (afterwards),
"I took it for granted you were a dead man."
"How should I dare to die," said he, "while you, sir, still
lived?"</p>

<p>On Ki Tsz-jen putting to him a question anent Tsz-lu
and Yen Yu, as to whether they might be called "great
ministers," the Master answered, "I had expected your
question, sir, to be about something extraordinary, and
lo! it is only about these two. Those whom we call 'great
ministers' are such as serve their prince conscientiously,
and who, when they cannot do so, retire. At present, as
regards the two you ask about, they may be called 'qualified
ministers.'"</p>

<p>"Well, are they then," he asked, "such as will follow
their leader?"</p>

<p>"They would not follow him who should slay his father
and his prince!" was the reply.</p>

<p>Through the intervention of Tsz-lu, Tsz-kÃ¡u was being
appointed governor of Pi.</p>

<p>"You are spoiling a good man's son," said the Master.</p>

<p>Tsz-lu rejoined, "But he will have the people and their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
superiors to gain experience from, and there will be the
altars; what need to read books? He can become a student
afterwards."</p>

<p>"Here is the reason for my hatred of glib-tongued people,"
said the Master.</p>

<p>On one occasion Tsz-lu, Tsang Sin, Yen Yu, and Kung-si
Hwa were sitting near him. He said to them, "Though I
may be a day older than you, do not (for the moment)
regard me as such. While you are living this unoccupied
life you are saying, 'We do not become known.' Now suppose
some one got to know you, what then?"</p>

<p>Tsz-lu&mdash;first to speak&mdash;at once answered, "Give me a
State of large size and armament, hemmed in and hampered
by other larger States, the population augmented
by armies and regiments, causing a dearth in it of food of
all kinds; give me charge of that State, and in three years'
time I should make a brave country of it, and let it know
its place."</p>

<p>The Master smiled at him. "Yen," said he, "how would
it be with you?"</p>

<p>"Give me," said Yen, "a territory of sixty or seventy li
square, or of fifty or sixty square; put me in charge of
that, and in three years I should make the people sufficiently
prosperous. As regards their knowledge of ceremonial
or music, I should wait for superior men to teach
them that."</p>

<p>"And with you, Kung-si, how would it be?"</p>

<p>This disciple's reply was, "I have nothing to say about
my capabilities for such matters; my wish is to learn. I
should like to be a junior assistant, in dark rob and cap,
at the services of the ancestral temple, and at the Grand
Receptions of the Princes by the Sovereign."</p>

<p>"And with you, Tsang Sin?"</p>

<p>This disciple was strumming on his harpsichord, but
now the twanging ceased, he turned from the instrument,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
rose to his feet, and answered thus: "Something different
from the choice of these three." "What harm?" said the
Master; "I want each one of you to tell me what his heart
is set upon." "Well, then," said he, "give me&mdash;in the latter
part of spring&mdash;dressed in full spring-tide attire&mdash;in company
with five or six young fellows of twenty,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> or six or
seven lads under that age, to do the ablutions in the I
stream, enjoy a breeze in the rain-dance,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and finish up
with songs on the road home."</p>

<p>The Master drew in his breath, sighed, and exclaimed,
"Ah, I take with you!"</p>

<p>The three other disciples having gone out, leaving
Tsang Sin behind, the latter said, "What think you of
the answers of those three?"&mdash;"Well, each told me what
was uppermost in his mind," said the Master;&mdash;"simply
that."</p>

<p>"Why did you smile at Tsz-lu, sir?"</p>

<p>"I smiled at him because to have the charge of a State
requires due regard to the Rules of Propriety, and his
words betrayed a lack of modesty."</p>

<p>"But Yen, then&mdash;he had a State in view, had he not?"</p>

<p>"I should like to be shown a territory such as he described
which does not amount to a State."</p>

<p>"But had not Kung-si also a State in view?"</p>

<p>"What are ancestral temples and Grand Receptions, but
for the feudal lords to take part in? If Kung-si were to
become an unimportant assistant at these functions, who
could become an important one?"</p>

<h2>BOOK XII</h2>
<h3><i>The Master's Answers&mdash;Philanthropy&mdash;Friendships</i></h3>

<p>Yen yuen was asking about man's proper regard for his
fellow-man. The Master said to him, "Self-control, and a
habit of falling back upon propriety, virtually effect it.
Let these conditions be fulfilled for one day, and every
one round will betake himself to the duty. Is it to begin
in one's self, or think you, indeed! it is to begin in others?"</p>

<p>"I wanted you to be good enough," said Yen Yuen, "to
give me a brief synopsis of it."</p>

<p>Then said the Master, "Without Propriety use not your
eyes; without it use not your ears, nor your tongue, nor a
limb of your body."</p>

<p>"I may be lacking in diligence," said Yen Yuen, "but
with your favor I will endeavor to carry out this advice."</p>

<p>Chung-kung asked about man's proper regard for his
fellows.</p>

<p>To him the Master replied thus: "When you go forth
from your door, be as if you were meeting some guest of
importance. When you are making use of the common
people (for State purposes), be as if you were taking part
in a great religious function. Do not set before others
what you do not desire yourself. Let there be no resentful
feelings against you when you are away in the country,
and none when at home."</p>

<p>"I may lack diligence," said Chung-kung, "but with
your favor I will endeavor to carry out this advice."</p>

<p>Sz-ma Niu asked the like question. The answer he received
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
was this: "The words of the man who has a proper
regard for his fellows are uttered with difficulty."</p>

<p>"'His words&mdash;uttered with difficulty?'" he echoed, in
surprise. "Is that what is meant by proper regard for one's
fellow-creatures?"</p>

<p>"Where there is difficulty in doing," the Master replied,
"will there not be some difficulty in utterance?"</p>

<p>The same disciple put a question about the "superior
man." "Superior men," he replied, "are free from trouble
and apprehension."</p>

<p>"'Free from trouble and apprehension!'" said he. "Does
that make them 'superior men'?"</p>

<p>The Master added, "Where there is found, upon introspection,
to be no chronic disease, how shall there be any
trouble? how shall there be any apprehension?"</p>

<p>The same disciple, being in trouble, remarked, "I am
alone in having no brother, while all else have theirs&mdash;younger
or elder."</p>

<p>Tsz-hiÃ¡ said to him, "I have heard this: 'Death and life
have destined times; wealth and honors rest with Heaven.
Let the superior man keep watch over himself without
ceasing, showing deference to others, with propriety of
manners&mdash;and all within the four seas will be his brethren.
How should he be distressed for lack of brothers!'"<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Tsz-chang asked what sort of man might be termed "enlightened."</p>

<p>The Master replied, "That man with whom drenching
slander and cutting calumny gain no currency may well
be called enlightened. Ay, he with whom such things make
no way may well be called enlightened in the extreme."</p>

<p>Tsz-kung put a question relative to government. In
reply the Master mentioned three essentials:&mdash;sufficient
food, sufficient armament, and the people's confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
    "But," said the disciple, "if you cannot really have all
three, and one has to be given up, which would you give
up first?"</p>

<p>"The armament," he replied.</p>

<p>"And if you are obliged to give up one of the remaining
two, which would it be?"</p>

<p>"The food," said he. "Death has been the portion of all
men from of old. Without the people's trust nothing can
stand."</p>

<p>Kih Tsz-shing once said, "Give me the inborn qualities
of a gentleman, and I want no more. How are such to
come from book-learning?"</p>

<p>Tsz-kung exclaimed, "Ah! sir, I regret to hear such
words from you. A gentleman!&mdash;But 'a team of four can
ne'er o'ertake the tongue!' Literary accomplishments are
much the same as inborn qualities, and inborn qualities as
literary accomplishments. A tiger's or leopard's skin without
the hair might be a dog's or sheep's when so made
bare."</p>

<p>Duke Ngai was consulting Yu Joh. Said he, "It is a year
of dearth, and there is an insufficiency for Ways and
Means&mdash;what am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Why not apply the Tithing Statute?" said the minister.</p>

<p>"But two tithings would not be enough for my purposes,"
said the duke; "what would be the good of applying
the Statute?"</p>

<p>The minister replied, "So long as the people have
enough left for themselves, who of them will allow their
prince to be without enough? But&mdash;when the people have
not enough, who will allow their prince all that he wants?"</p>

<p>Tsz-chang was asking how the standard of virtue was to
be raised, and how to discern what was illusory or misleading.
The Master's answer was, "Give a foremost place
to honesty and faithfulness, and tread the path of righteousness,
and you will raise the standard of virtue. As to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
discerning what is illusory, here is an example of an illusion:&mdash;Whom
you love you wish to live; whom you hate
you wish to die. To have wished the same person to live
and also to be dead&mdash;there is an illusion for you."</p>

<p>Duke King of Ts&lsquo;i consulted Confucius about government.
His answer was, "Let a prince be a prince, and
ministers be ministers; let fathers be fathers, and sons be
sons."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed the duke; "truly if a prince fail to
be a prince, and ministers to be ministers, and if fathers
be not fathers, and sons not sons, then, even though I
may have my allowance of grain, should I ever be able to
relish it?"</p>

<p>"The man to decide a cause with half a word," exclaimed
the Master, "is Tsz-lu!"</p>

<p>Tsz-lu never let a night pass between promise and performance.</p>

<p>"In hearing causes, I am like other men," said the Master.
"The great point is&mdash;to prevent litigation."</p>

<p>Tsz-chang having raised some question about government,
the Master said to him, "In the settlement of its
principles be unwearied; in its administration&mdash;see to that
loyally."</p>

<p>"The man of wide research," said he, "who also restrains
himself by the Rules of Propriety, is not likely to transgress."</p>

<p>Again, "The noble-minded man makes the most of
others' good qualities, not the worst of their bad ones.
Men of small mind do the reverse of this."</p>

<p>Ki K&lsquo;ang was consulting him about the direction of public
affairs. Confucius answered him, "A director should be
himself correct. If you, sir, as a leader show correctness,
who will dare not to be correct?"</p>

<p>Ki K&lsquo;ang, being much troubled on account of robbers
abroad, consulted Confucius on the matter. He received
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
this reply: "If you, sir, were not covetous, neither would
they steal, even were you to bribe them to do so."</p>

<p>Ki K&lsquo;ang, when consulting Confucius about the government,
said, "Suppose I were to put to death the disorderly
for the better encouragement of the orderly&mdash;what say
you to that?"</p>

<p>"Sir," replied Confucius, "in the administration of government
why resort to capital punishment? Covet what is
good, and the people will be good. The virtue of the
noble-minded man is as the wind, and that of inferior men
as grass; the grass must bend, when the wind blows upon
it."</p>

<p>Tsz-chang asked how otherwise he would describe the
learned official who might be termed influential.</p>

<p>"What, I wonder, do you mean by one who is influential?"
said the Master.</p>

<p>"I mean," replied the disciple, "one who is sure to have
a reputation throughout the country, as well as at home."</p>

<p>"That," said the Master, "is reputation, not influence.
The influential man, then, if he be one who is genuinely
straightforward and loves what is just and right, a discriminator
of men's words, and an observer of their looks,
and in honor careful to prefer others to himself&mdash;will certainly
have influence, both throughout the country and at
home. The man of mere reputation, on the other hand,
who speciously affects philanthropy, though in his way of
procedure he acts contrary to it, while yet quite evidently
engrossed with that virtue&mdash;will certainly have reputation,
both in the country and at home."</p>

<p>Fan Ch&lsquo;i, strolling with him over the ground below the
place of the rain-dance, said to him, "I venture to ask how
to raise the standard of virtue, how to reform dissolute
habits, and how to discern what is illusory?"</p>

<p>"Ah! a good question indeed!" he exclaimed. "Well, is
not putting duty first, and success second, a way of raising
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the standard of virtue? And is not attacking the evil in
one's self, and not the evil which is in others, a way of
reforming dissolute habits? And as to illusions, is not one
morning's fit of anger, causing a man to forget himself,
and even involving in the consequences those who are
near and dear to him&mdash;is not that an illusion?"</p>

<p>The same disciple asked him what was meant by "a
right regard for one's fellow-creatures." He replied, "It is
love to man."</p>

<p>Asked by him again what was meant by wisdom, he replied,
"It is knowledge of man."</p>

<p>Fan Ch&lsquo;i did not quite grasp his meaning.</p>

<p>The Master went on to say, "Lift up the straight, set
aside the crooked, so can you make the crooked straight."</p>

<p>Fan Ch&lsquo;i left him, and meeting with Tsz-hiÃ¡ he said, "I
had an interview just now with the Master, and I asked
him what wisdom was. In his answer he said, 'Lift up the
straight, set aside the crooked, and so can you make the
crooked straight.' What was his meaning?"</p>

<p>"Ah! words rich in meaning, those," said the other.
"When Shun was emperor, and was selecting his men
from among the multitude, he 'lifted up' KÃ¡u-yÃ¡u; and
men devoid of right feelings towards their kind went far
away. And when T&lsquo;ang was emperor, and chose out his
men from the crowd, he 'lifted up' I-yin&mdash;with the same
result."</p>

<p>Tsz-kung was consulting him about a friend. "Speak
to him frankly, and respectfully," said the Master, "and
gently lead him on. If you do not succeed, then stop; do
not submit yourself to indignity."</p>

<p>The learned Tsang observed, "In the society of books
the 'superior man' collects his friends; in the society of
his friends he is furthering good-will among men."</p>

<h2>BOOK XIII</h2>
<h3><i>Answers on the Art of Governing&mdash;Consistency</i></h3>

<p>Tsz-lu was asking about government. "Lead the way in
it," said the Master, "and work hard at it."</p>

<p>Requested to say more, he added, "And do not tire of it."</p>

<p>Chung-kung, on being made first minister to the Chief
of the Ki family, consulted the Master about government,
and to him he said, "Let the heads of offices be heads.
Excuse small faults. Promote men of sagacity and talent."</p>

<p>"But," he asked, "how am I to know the sagacious and
talented, before promoting them?"</p>

<p>"Promote those whom you do know," said the Master.</p>

<p>"As to those of whom you are uncertain, will others
omit to notice them?"</p>

<p>Tsz-lu said to the Master, "As the prince of Wei, sir,
has been waiting for you to act for him in his government,
what is it your intention to take in hand first?"</p>

<p>"One thing of necessity," he answered&mdash;"the rectification
of terms."</p>

<p>"That!" exclaimed Tsz-lu. "How far away you are, sir!
Why such rectification?"</p>

<p>"What a rustic you are, Tsz-lu!" rejoined the Master.
"A gentleman would be a little reserved and reticent in
matters which he does not understand. If terms be incorrect,
language will be incongruous; and if language be
incongruous, deeds will be imperfect. So, again, when
deeds are imperfect, propriety and harmony cannot prevail,
and when this is the case laws relating to crime will
fail in their aim; and if these last so fail, the people will not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
know where to set hand or foot. Hence, a man of superior
mind, certain first of his terms, is fitted to speak; and being
certain of what he says can proceed upon it. In the language
of such a person there is nothing heedlessly irregular&mdash;and
that is the sum of the matter."</p>

<p>Fan Ch&lsquo;i requested that he might learn something of
husbandry. "For that," said the Master, "I am not equal
to an old husbandman." Might he then learn something
of gardening? he asked. "I am not equal to an old gardener,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"A man of little mind, that!" said the Master, when Fan
Ch&lsquo;i had gone out. "Let a man who is set over the people
love propriety, and they will not presume to be disrespectful.
Let him be a lover of righteousness, and they will not
presume to be aught but submissive. Let him love faithfulness
and truth, and they will not presume not to lend
him their hearty assistance. Ah, if all this only were so,
the people from all sides would come to such a one, carrying
their children on their backs. What need to turn his
hand to husbandry?</p>

<p>"Though a man," said he, "could hum through the Odes&mdash;the
three hundred&mdash;yet should show himself unskilled
when given some administrative work to do for his country;
though he might know much of that other lore, yet
if, when sent on a mission to any quarter, he could answer
no question personally and unaided, what after all is he
good for?</p>

<p>"Let a leader," said he, "show rectitude in his own personal
character, and even without directions from him
things will go well. If he be not personally upright, his
directions will not be complied with."</p>

<p>Once he made the remark, "The governments of Lu and
of Wei are in brotherhood."</p>

<p>Of King, a son of the Duke of Wei, he observed that
"he managed his household matters well. On his coming
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
into possession, he thought, 'What a strange conglomeration!'&mdash;Coming
to possess a little more, it was, 'Strange,
such a result!' And when he became wealthy, 'Strange,
such elegance!'"</p>

<p>The Master was on a journey to Wei, and Yen Yu was
driving him. "What multitudes of people!" he exclaimed.
Yen Yu asked him, "Seeing they are so numerous, what
more would you do for them?"</p>

<p>"Enrich them," replied the Master.</p>

<p>"And after enriching them, what more would you do
for them?"</p>

<p>"Instruct them."</p>

<p>"Were any one of our princes to employ me," he said,
"after a twelvemonth I might have made some tolerable
progress; but give me three years, and my work should
be done."</p>

<p>Again, "How true is that saying, 'Let good men have the
management of a country for a century, and they would
be adequate to cope with evil-doers, and thus do away
with capital punishments.'"</p>

<p>Again, "Suppose the ruler to possess true kingly qualities,
then surely after one generation there would be
good-will among men."</p>

<p>Again, "Let a ruler but see to his own rectitude, and
what trouble will he then have in the work before him? If
he be unable to rectify himself, how is he to rectify
others?"</p>

<p>Once when Yen Yu was leaving the Court, the Master
accosted him. "Why so late?" he asked. "Busy with legislation,"
Yen replied. "The details of it," suggested the
Master; "had it been legislation, I should have been there
to hear it, even though I am not in office."</p>

<p>Duke Ting asked if there were one sentence which, if
acted upon, might have the effect of making a country
prosperous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
    Confucius answered, "A sentence could hardly be supposed
to do so much as that. But there is a proverb people
use which says, 'To play the prince is hard, to play the
minister not easy.' Assuming that it is understood that 'to
play the prince is hard,' would it not be probable that with
that one sentence the country should be made to prosper?"</p>

<p>"Is there, then," he asked, "one sentence which, if acted
upon, would have the effect of ruining a country?"</p>

<p>Confucius again replied, "A sentence could hardly be
supposed to do so much as that. But there is a proverb
men have which says, 'Not gladly would I play the prince,
unless my words were ne'er withstood.' Assuming that the
words were good, and that none withstood them, would
not that also be good? But assuming that they were not
good, and yet none withstood them, would it not be probable
that with that one saying he would work his country's
ruin?"</p>

<p>When the Duke of Sheh consulted him about government,
he replied, "Where the near are gratified, the war
will follow."</p>

<p>When Tsz-hiÃ¡ became governor of KÃ¼-fu, and consulted
him about government, he answered, "Do not wish for
speedy results. Do not look at trivial advantages. If you
wish for speedy results, they will not be far-reaching; and
if you regard trivial advantages you will not successfully
deal with important affairs."</p>

<p>The Duke of Sheh in a conversation with Confucius
said, "There are some straightforward persons in my
neighborhood. If a father has stolen a sheep, the son will
give evidence against him."</p>

<p>"Straightforward people in my neighborhood are different
from those," said Confucius. "The father will hold a
thing secret on his son's behalf, and the son does the same
for his father. They are on their way to becoming straightforward."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
    Fan Ch&lsquo;i was asking him about duty to one's fellow-men.
"Be courteous," he replied, "in your private sphere;
be serious in any duty you take in hand to do; be leal-hearted
in your intercourse with others. Even though you
were to go amongst the wild tribes, it would not be right
for you to neglect these duties."</p>

<p>In answer to Tsz-kung, who asked, "how he would
characterize one who could fitly be called 'learned official,'"
the Master said, "He may be so-called who in his
private life is affected with a sense of his own unworthiness,
and who, when sent on a mission to any quarter of
the empire, would not disgrace his prince's commands."</p>

<p>"May I presume," said his questioner, "to ask what sort
you would put next to such?"</p>

<p>"Him who is spoken of by his kinsmen as a dutiful
son, and whom the folks of his neighborhood call 'good
brother.'"</p>

<p>"May I still venture to ask whom you would place next
in order?"</p>

<p>"Such as are sure to be true to their word, and effective
in their work&mdash;who are given to hammering, as it were,
upon one note&mdash;of inferior calibre indeed, but fit enough,
I think, to be ranked next."</p>

<p>"How would you describe those who are at present in
the government service?"</p>

<p>"Ugh! mere peck and panier men!&mdash;not worth taking
into the reckoning."</p>

<p>Once he remarked, "If I cannot get <i>via media</i> men to
impart instruction to, then I must of course take the impetuous
and undisciplined! The impetuous ones will at
least go forward and lay hold on things; and the undisciplined
have at least something in them which needs to be
brought out."</p>

<p>"The Southerners," said he, "have the proverb, 'The
man who sticks not to rule will never make a charm-worker
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
or a medical man.' Good!&mdash;'Whoever is intermittent
in his practise of virtue will live to be ashamed of it.'
Without prognostication," he added, "that will indeed be
so."</p>

<p>"The nobler-minded man," he remarked, "will be agreeable
even when he disagrees; the small-minded man will
agree and be disagreeable."</p>

<p>Tsz-kung was consulting him, and asked, "What say you
of a person who was liked by all in his village?"</p>

<p>"That will scarcely do," he answered.</p>

<p>"What, then, if they all disliked him?"</p>

<p>"That, too," said he, "is scarcely enough. Better if he
were liked by the good folk in the village, and disliked by
the bad."</p>

<p>"The superior man," he once observed, "is easy to serve,
but difficult to please. Try to please him by the adoption
of wrong principles, and you will fail. Also, when such a
one employs others, he uses them according to their capacity.
The inferior man is, on the other hand, difficult to
serve, but easy to please. Try to please him by the adoption
of wrong principles, and you will succeed. And when
he employs others he requires them to be fully prepared
for everything."</p>

<p>Again, "The superior man can be high without being
haughty. The inferior man can be haughty if not high."</p>

<p>"The firm, the unflinching, the plain and simple, the
slow to speak," said he once, "are approximating towards
their duty to their fellow-men."</p>

<p>Tsz-lu asked how he would characterize one who might
fitly be called an educated gentleman. The master replied,
"He who can properly be so-called will have in him a
seriousness of purpose, a habit of controlling himself, and
an agreeableness of manner: among his friends and associates
the seriousness and the self-control, and among his
brethren the agreeableness of manner."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
    "Let good and able men discipline the people for seven
years," said the Master, "and after that they may do to go
to war."</p>

<p>But, said he, "To lead an undisciplined people to war&mdash;that
I call throwing them away."</p>

<h2>BOOK XIV</h2>
<h3><i>Good and Bad Government&mdash;Miscellaneous Sayings</i></h3>

<p>Yuen Sz asked what might be considered to bring shame
on one.</p>

<p>"Pay," said the Master; "pay&mdash;ever looking to that,
whether the country be well or badly governed."</p>

<p>"When imperiousness, boastfulness, resentments, and
covetousness cease to prevail among the people, may it
be considered that mutual good-will has been effected?"
To this question the Master replied, "A hard thing overcome,
it may be considered. But as to the mutual good-will&mdash;I
cannot tell."</p>

<p>"Learned officials," said he, "who hanker after a home
life, are not worthy of being esteemed as such."</p>

<p>Again, "In a country under good government, speak
boldly, act boldly. When the land is ill-governed, though
you act boldly, let your words be moderate."</p>

<p>Again, "Men of virtue will needs be men of words&mdash;will
speak out&mdash;but men of words are not necessarily
men of virtue. They who care for their fellow-men will
needs be bold, but the bold may not necessarily be such
as care for their fellow-men."</p>

<p>Nan-kung Kwoh, who was consulting Confucius, observed
respecting I, the skilful archer, and Ngau, who
could propel a boat on dry land, that neither of them died
a natural death; while Yu and Tsih, who with their own
hands had labored at husbandry, came to wield imperial
sway.</p>

<p>The Master gave him no reply. But when the speaker
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
had gone out he exclaimed, "A superior man, that! A man
who values virtue, that!"</p>

<p>"There have been noble-minded men," said he, "who
yet were wanting in philanthropy; but never has there
been a small-minded man who had philanthropy in him."</p>

<p>He asked, "Can any one refuse to toil for those he loves?
Can any one refuse to exhort, who is true-hearted?"</p>

<p>Speaking of the preparation of Government Notifications
in his day he said, "P&lsquo;i would draw up a rough sketch
of what was to be said; the Shishuh then looked it carefully
through and put it into proper shape; Tsz-yu next,
who was master of the ceremonial of State intercourse,
improved and adorned its phrases; and Tsz-ch&lsquo;an of Tung-li
added his scholarly embellishments thereto."</p>

<p>To some one who asked his opinion of the last-named,
he said, "He was a kind-hearted man." Asked what he
thought of Tsz-si, he exclaimed, "Alas for him! alas for
him!"&mdash;Asked again about Kwan Chung, his answer was,
"As to him, he once seized the town of P&lsquo;in with its three
hundred families from the Chief of the Pih clan, who,
afterwards reduced to living upon coarse rice, with all his
teeth gone, never uttered a word of complaint."</p>

<p>"It is no light thing," said he, "to endure poverty uncomplainingly;
and a difficult thing to bear wealth without
becoming arrogant."</p>

<p>Respecting Mang Kung-ch&lsquo;oh, he said that, while he
was fitted for something better than the post of chief
officer in the ChÃ¡u or Wei families, he was not competent
to act as minister in small States like those of T&lsquo;ang or
Sieh.</p>

<p>Tsz-lu asked how he would describe a perfect man. He
replied, "Let a man have the sagacity of Tsang Wu-chung,
the freedom from covetousness of Kung-ch&lsquo;oh, the boldness
of Chwang of P&lsquo;in, and the attainments in polite arts
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of Yen Yu; and gift him further with the graces taught by
the 'Books of Rites' and 'Music'&mdash;then he may be considered
a perfect man. But," said he, "what need of such
in these days? The man that may be regarded as perfect
now is the one who, seeing some advantage to himself, is
mindful of righteousness; who, seeing danger, risks his life;
and who, if bound by some covenant of long standing,
never forgets its conditions as life goes on."</p>

<p>Respecting Kung-shuh Wan, the Master inquired of
Kung-ming KiÃ¡, saying, "Is it true that your master never
speaks, never laughs, never takes aught from others?"</p>

<p>"Those who told you that of him," said he, "have gone
too far. My master speaks when there is occasion to do so,
and men are not surfeited with his speaking. When there
is occasion to be merry too, he will laugh, but men have
never over much of his laughing. And whenever it is just
and right to take things from others, he will take them,
but never so as to allow men to think him burdensome."
"Is that the case with him?" said the Master. "Can it be
so?"</p>

<p>Respecting Tsang Wu-chung the Master said, "When
he sought from Lu the appointment of a successor to him,
and for this object held on to his possession of the fortified
city of Fang&mdash;if you say he was not then using constraint
towards his prince, I must refuse to believe it."</p>

<p>Duke Wan of Tsin he characterized as "artful but not
upright"; and Duke Hwan of Ts'i as "upright but not artful."</p>

<p>Tsz-lu remarked, "When Duke Hwan caused his brother
Kiu to be put to death, Shau Hwuh committed suicide,
but Kwan Chung did not. I should say he was not a man
who had much good-will in him&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>The Master replied, "When Duke Hwan held a great
gathering of the feudal lords, dispensing with military
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
equipage, it was owing to Kwan Chung's energy that such
an event was brought about. Match such good-will as that&mdash;match
it if you can."</p>

<p>Tsz-kung then spoke up. "But was not Kwan Chung
wanting in good-will? He could not give up his life when
Duke Hwan caused his brother to be put to death. Besides,
he became the duke's counsellor."</p>

<p>"And in acting as his counsellor put him at the head of
all the feudal lords," said the Master, "and unified and
reformed the whole empire; and the people, even to this
day, reap benefit from what he did. Had it not been for
him we should have been going about with locks unkempt
and buttoning our jackets (like barbarians) on the left.
Would you suppose that he should show the same sort of
attachment as exists between a poor yokel and his one wife&mdash;that
he would asphyxiate himself in some sewer, leaving
no one the wiser?"</p>

<p>Kung-shuh Wan's steward, who became the high officer
Sien, went up accompanied by Wan to the prince's hall of
audience.</p>

<p>When Confucius heard of this he remarked, "He may
well be esteemed a 'Wan.'"</p>

<p>The Master having made some reference to the lawless
ways of Duke Ling of Wei, Ki K&lsquo;ang said to him, "If he
be like that, how is it he does not ruin his position?"</p>

<p>Confucius answered, "The Chung-shuh, Yu, is charged
with the entertainment of visitors and strangers; the priest
T&lsquo;o has charge of the ancestral temple; and Wang-sun
KiÃ¡ has the control of the army and its divisions:&mdash;with
men such as those, how should he come to ruin?"</p>

<p>He once remarked, "He who is unblushing in his words
will with difficulty substantiate them."</p>

<p>Ch&lsquo;in Shing had slain Duke Kien. Hearing of this, Confucius,
after performing his ablutions, went to Court and
announced the news to Duke Ngai, saying, "Ch&lsquo;in Shing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
has slain his prince. May I request that you proceed
against him?"</p>

<p>"Inform the Chiefs of the Three Families," said the
duke.</p>

<p>Soliloquizing upon this, Confucius said, "Since he uses
me to back his ministers,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> I did not dare not to announce
the matter to him; and now he says, 'Inform the Three
Chiefs.'"</p>

<p>He went to the Three Chiefs and informed them, but
nothing could be done. Whereupon again he said, "Since
he uses me to back his ministers, I did not dare not to
announce the matter."</p>

<p>Tsz-lu was questioning him as to how he should serve
his prince. "Deceive him not, but reprove him," he answered.</p>

<p>"The minds of superior men," he observed, "trend upwards;
those of inferior men trend downwards."</p>

<p>Again, "Students of old fixed their eyes upon themselves:
now they learn with their eyes upon others."</p>

<p>KÃ¼ Pih-yuh despatched a man with a message to Confucius.
Confucius gave him a seat, and among other inquiries
he asked, "How is your master managing?" "My
master," he replied, "has a great wish to be seldom at
fault, and as yet he cannot manage it."</p>

<p>"What a messenger!" exclaimed he, admiringly, when
the man went out. "What a messenger!"</p>

<p>"When not occupying the office," was a remark of his,
"devise not the policy."</p>

<p>The Learned Tsang used to say, "The thoughts of the
'superior man' do not wander from his own office."</p>

<p>"Superior men," said the Master, "are modest in their
words, profuse in their deeds."</p>

<p>Again, "There are three attainments of the superior man
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
which are beyond me&mdash;the being sympathetic without
anxiety, wise without scepticism, brave without fear."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Tsz-kung, "that is what you say of yourself."</p>

<p>Whenever Tsz-kung drew comparisons from others, the
Master would say, "Ah, how wise and great you must have
become! Now I have no time to do that."</p>

<p>Again, "My great concern is, not that men do not know
me, but that they cannot."</p>

<p>Again, "If a man refrain from making preparations
against his being imposed upon, and from counting upon
others' want of good faith towards him, while he is foremost
to perceive what is passing&mdash;surely that is a wise and
good man."</p>

<p>Wi-shang Mau accosted Confucius, saying, "Kiu, how
comes it that you manage to go perching and roosting in
this way? Is it not because you show yourself so smart a
speaker, now?"</p>

<p>"I should not dare do that," said Confucius. "'Tis that I
am sick of men's immovableness and deafness to reason."</p>

<p>"In a well-bred horse," said he, "what one admires is not
its speed, but its good points."</p>

<p>Some one asked, "What say you of the remark, 'Requite
enmity with kindness'?"</p>

<p>"How then," he answered, "would you requite kindness?
Requite enmity with straightforwardness, and kindness
with kindness."</p>

<p>"Ah! no one knows me!" he once exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Tsz-kung, "how comes it to pass that no one
knows you?"</p>

<p>"While I murmur not against Heaven," continued the
Master, "nor cavil at men; while I stoop to learn and aspire
to penetrate into things that are high; yet 'tis Heaven
alone knows what I am."</p>

<p>LiÃ¡u, a kinsman of the duke, having laid a complaint
against Tsz-lu before Ki K&lsquo;ang, an officer came to Confucius
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
to inform him of the fact, and he added, "My lord
is certainly having his mind poisoned by his kinsman LiÃ¡u,
but through my influence perhaps we may yet manage to
see him exposed in the market-place or the Court."</p>

<p>"If right principles are to have their course, it is so
destined," said the Master; "if they are not to have their
course, it is so destined. What can LiÃ¡u do against Destiny?"</p>

<p>"There are worthy men," said the Master, "fleeing from
the world; some from their district; some from the sight
of men's looks; some from the language they hear."</p>

<p>"The men who have risen from their posts and withdrawn
in this manner are seven in number."</p>

<p>Tsz-lu, having lodged overnight in Shih-mun, was accosted
by the gate-keeper in the morning. "Where from?"
he asked. "From Confucius," Tsz-lu responded. "That is
the man," said he, "who knows things are not up to the
mark, and is making some ado about them, is it not?"</p>

<p>When the Master was in Wei, he was once pounding
on the musical stone, when a man with a basket of straw
crossed his threshold, and exclaimed, "Ah, there is a heart
that feels! Aye, drub the stone!" After which he added,
"How vulgar! how he hammers away on one note!&mdash;and
no one knows him, and he gives up, and all is over!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Be it deep, our skirts we'll raise to the waist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Or shallow, then up to the knee.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"What determination!" said the Master. "Yet it was not
hard to do."</p>

<p>Tsz-chang once said to him, "In the 'Book of the Annals'
it is stated that while KÃ¡u-tsung was in the Mourning
Shed he spent the three years without speaking. What is
meant by that?"</p>

<p>"Why must you name KÃ¡u-tsung?" said the Master. "It
was so with all other ancient sovereigns: when one of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
them died, the heads of every department agreed between
themselves that they should give ear for three years to the
Prime Minister."</p>

<p>"When their betters love the Rules, then the folk are
easy tools," was a saying of the Master.</p>

<p>Tsz-lu having asked what made a "superior man," he
answered, "Self-culture, with a view to becoming seriously-minded."</p>

<p>"Nothing more than that?" said he.</p>

<p>"Self-culture with a view to the greater satisfaction of
others," added the Master.</p>

<p>"That, and yet no more?"</p>

<p>"Self-culture with a view to the greater satisfaction of
all the clans and classes," he again added. "Self-culture
for the sake of all&mdash;a result that, that would almost put
Yau and Shun into the shade!"</p>

<p>To Yuen Jang,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> who was sitting waiting for him in a
squatting (disrespectful) posture, the Master delivered
himself as follows: "The man who in his youth could show
no humility or subordination, who in his prime misses his
opportunity, and who when old age comes upon him will
not die&mdash;that man is a miscreant." And he tapped him on
the shin with his staff.</p>

<p>Some one asked about his attendant&mdash;a youth from the
village of Kiueh&mdash;whether he was one who improved.
He replied, "I note that he seats himself in the places reserved
for his betters, and that when he is walking he
keeps abreast with his seniors. He is not one of those who
care for improvement: he wants to be a man all at once."</p>

<h2>BOOK XV</h2>
<h3><i>Practical Wisdom&mdash;Reciprocity the Rule of Life</i></h3>

<p>Duke Ling of Wei was consulting Confucius about army
arrangements. His answer was, "Had you asked me about
such things as temple requisites, I have learnt that business,
but I have not yet studied military matters." And he
followed up this reply by leaving on the following day.</p>

<p>After this, during his residence in the State of Ch&lsquo;in,
his followers, owing to a stoppage of food supply, became
so weak and ill that not one of them could stand. Tsz-lu,
with indignation pictured on his countenance, exclaimed,
"And is a gentleman to suffer starvation?"</p>

<p>"A gentleman," replied the Master, "will endure it unmoved,
but a common person breaks out into excesses
under it."</p>

<p>Addressing Tsz-kung, the Master said, "You regard me
as one who studies and stores up in his mind a multiplicity
of things&mdash;do you not?"&mdash;"I do," he replied; "is it not so?"&mdash;"Not
at all. I have one idea&mdash;one cord on which to
string all."</p>

<p>To Tsz-lu he remarked, "They who know Virtue are
rare."</p>

<p>"If you would know one who without effort ruled well,
was not Shun such a one? What did he indeed do? He
bore himself with reverent dignity and undeviatingly
'faced the south,' and that was all."</p>

<p>Tsz-chang was consulting him about making way in
life. He answered, "Be true and honest in all you say, and
seriously earnest in all you do, and then, even if your country
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
be one inhabited by barbarians, South or North, you
will make your way. If you do not show yourself thus in
word and deed how should you succeed, even in your
own district or neighborhood?&mdash;When you are afoot, let
these two counsels be two companions preceding you,
yourself viewing them from behind; when you drive, have
them in view as on the yoke of your carriage. Then may
you make your way."</p>

<p>Tsz-chang wrote them on the two ends of his cincture.</p>

<p>"Straight was the course of the Annalist Yu," said the
Master&mdash;"aye, straight as an arrow flies; were the country
well governed or ill governed, his was an arrow-like
course.</p>

<p>"A man of masterly mind, too, is KÃ¼ Pih-yuh! When the
land is being rightly governed he will serve; when it is
under bad government he is apt to recoil, and brood."</p>

<p>"Not to speak to a man," said he, "to whom you ought
to speak, is to lose your man; to speak to one to whom you
ought not to speak is to lose your words. Those who are
wise will not lose their man, nor yet their words."</p>

<p>Again, "The scholar whose heart is in his work, and who
is philanthropic, seeks not to gain a livelihood by any
means that will do harm to his philanthropy. There have
been men who have destroyed their own lives in the endeavor
to bring that virtue in them to perfection."</p>

<p>Tsz-kung asked how to become philanthropic. The Master
answered him thus: "A workman who wants to do his
work well must first sharpen his tools. In whatever land
you live, serve under some wise and good man among
those in high office, and make friends with the more
humane of its men of education."</p>

<p>Yen Yuen consulted him on the management of a country.
He answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go by the HiÃ¡ Calendar. Have the State carriages like
those of the Yin princes. Wear the Chow cap. For your
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
music let that of Shun be used for the posturers. Put away
the songs of Ch&lsquo;ing, and remove far from you men of artful
speech: the Ch&lsquo;ing songs are immodest, and artful
talkers are dangerous."</p>

<p>Other sayings of the Master:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They who care not for the morrow will the sooner have
their sorrow.</p>

<p>"Ah, 'tis hopeless! I have not yet met with the man who
loves Virtue as he loves Beauty.</p>

<p>"Was not Tsang Wan like one who surreptitiously came
by the post he held? He knew the worth of HwÃºi of Liu-hiÃ¡,
and could not stand in his presence.</p>

<p>"Be generous yourself, and exact little from others; then
you banish complaints.</p>

<p>"With one who does not come to me inquiring 'What of
this?' and 'What of that?' I never can ask 'What of this?'
and give him up.</p>

<p>"If a number of students are all day together, and in
their conversation never approach the subject of righteousness,
but are fond merely of giving currency to smart
little sayings, they are difficult indeed to manage.</p>

<p>"When the 'superior man' regards righteousness as the
thing material, gives operation to it according to the Rules
of Propriety, lets it issue in humility, and become complete
in sincerity&mdash;there indeed is your superior man!</p>

<p>"The trouble of the superior man will be his own want
of ability: it will be no trouble to him that others do not
know him.</p>

<p>"Such a man thinks it hard to end his days and leave a
name to be no longer named.</p>

<p>"The superior man is exacting of himself; the common
man is exacting of others.</p>

<p>"A superior man has self-respect, and does not strive; is
sociable, yet no party man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
    "He does not promote a man because of his words, or
pass over the words because of the man."</p>

<p>Tsz-kung put to him the question, "Is there one word
upon which the whole life may proceed?"</p>

<p>The Master replied, "Is not Reciprocity such a word?&mdash;what
you do not yourself desire, do not put before
others."</p>

<p>"So far as I have to do with others, whom do I over-censure?
whom do I over-praise? If there be something
in them that looks very praiseworthy, that something I
put to the test. I would have the men of the present day
to walk in the straight path whereby those of the Three
Dynasties have walked.</p>

<p>"I have arrived as it were at the annalist's blank page.&mdash;Once
he who had a horse would lend it to another to
mount; now, alas! it is not so.</p>

<p>"Artful speech is the confusion of Virtue. Impatience
over little things introduces confusion into great schemes.</p>

<p>"What is disliked by the masses needs inquiring into; so
also does that which they have a preference for.</p>

<p>"A man may give breadth to his principles: it is not
principles (in themselves) that give breadth to the man.</p>

<p>"Not to retract after committing an error may itself be
called error.</p>

<p>"If I have passed the whole day without food and the
whole night without sleep, occupied with my thoughts, it
profits me nothing: I were better engaged in learning.</p>

<p>"The superior man deliberates upon how he may walk
in truth, not upon what he may eat. The farmer may
plough, and be on the way to want: the student learns,
and is on his way to emolument. To live a right life is the
concern of men of nobler minds: poverty gives them none.</p>

<p>"Whatsoever the intellect may attain to, unless the humanity
within is powerful enough to keep guard over it,
is assuredly lost, even though it be gained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
    "If there be intellectual attainments, and the humanity
within is powerful enough to keep guard over them, yet,
unless (in a ruler) there be dignity in his rule, the people
will fail to show him respect.</p>

<p>"Again, given the intellectual attainments, and humanity
sufficient to keep watch over them, and also dignity
in ruling, yet if his movements be not in accordance
with the Rules of Propriety, he is not yet fully qualified.</p>

<p>"The superior man may not be conversant with petty
details, and yet may have important matters put into his
hands. The inferior man may not be charged with important
matters, yet may be conversant with the petty details.</p>

<p>"Good-fellowship is more to men than fire and water. I
have seen men stepping into fire and into water, and meeting
with death thereby; I have not yet seen a man die
from planting his steps in the path of good-fellowship.</p>

<p>"Rely upon good nature. 'Twill not allow precedence
even to a teacher.</p>

<p>"The superior man is inflexibly upright, and takes not
things upon trust.</p>

<p>"In serving your prince, make your service the serious
concern, and let salary be a secondary matter.</p>

<p>"Where instruction is to be given, there must be no distinction
of persons.</p>

<p>"Where men's methods are not identical, there can be
no planning by one on behalf of another.</p>

<p>"In speaking, perspicuity is all that is needed."</p>

<p>When the blind music-master Mien paid him a visit, on
his approaching the steps the Master called out "Steps,"
and on his coming to the mat, said "Mat." When all in the
room were seated, the Master told him "So-and-so is here,
so-and-so is here."</p>

<p>When the music-master had left, Tsz-chang said to him,
"Is that the way to speak to the music-master?" "Well," he
replied, "it is certainly the way to assist him."</p>

<h2>BOOK XVI</h2>
<h3><i>Against Intestine Strife&mdash;Good and Bad Friendships</i></h3>

<p>The Chief of the Ki family was about to make an onslaught
upon the Chuen-yu domain.</p>

<p>Yen Yu and Tsz-lu in an interview with Confucius told
him, "The Ki is about to have an affair with Chuen-yu."</p>

<p>"Yen," said Confucius, "does not the fault lie with you?
The Chief of Chuen-yu in times past was appointed lord
of the East Mung (mountain); besides, he dwells within
the confines of your own State, and is an official of the
State-worship; how can you think of making an onslaught
upon him?"</p>

<p>"It is the wish of our Chief," said Yen Yu, "not the wish
of either of us ministers."</p>

<p>Confucius said, "Yen, there is a sentence of ChÃ¡u Jin
which runs thus: 'Having made manifest their powers and
taken their place in the official list, when they find themselves
incompetent they resign; if they cannot be firm
when danger threatens the government, nor lend support
when it is reeling, of what use then shall they be as Assistants?'&mdash;Besides,
you are wrong in what you said. When
a rhinoceros or tiger breaks out of its cage&mdash;when a jewel
or tortoise-shell ornament is damaged in its casket&mdash;whose
fault is it?"</p>

<p>"But," said Yen Yu, "so far as Chuen-yu is concerned, it
is now fortified, and it is close to Pi; and if he does not
now take it, in another generation it will certainly be a
trouble to his descendants."</p>

<p>"Yen!" exclaimed Confucius, "it is a painful thing to a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
superior man to have to desist from saying, 'My wish is so-and-so,'
and to be obliged to make apologies. For my part,
I have learnt this&mdash;that rulers of States and heads of
Houses are not greatly concerned about their small following,
but about the want of equilibrium in it&mdash;that they
do not concern themselves about their becoming poor, but
about the best means of living quietly and contentedly;
for where equilibrium is preserved there will be no poverty,
where there is harmony their following will not be
small, and where there is quiet contentment there will be
no decline nor fall. Now if that be the case, it follows that
if men in outlying districts are not submissive, then a reform
in education and morals will bring them to; and
when they have been so won, then will you render them
quiet and contented. At the present time you two are
Assistants of your Chief; the people in the outlying districts
are not submissive, and cannot be brought round.
Your dominion is divided, prostrate, dispersed, cleft in
pieces, and you as its guardians are powerless. And plans
are being made for taking up arms against those who dwell
within your own State. I am apprehensive that the sorrow
of the Ki family is not to lie in Chuen-yu, but in those
within their own screen."</p>

<p>"When the empire is well-ordered," said Confucius, "it
is from the emperor that edicts regarding ceremonial, music,
and expeditions to quell rebellion go forth. When it is
being ill governed, such edicts emanate from the feudal
lords; and when the latter is the case, it will be strange if
in ten generations there is not a collapse. If they emanate
merely from the high officials, it will be strange if the collapse
do not come in five generations. When the State-edicts
are in the hands of the subsidiary ministers, it will
be strange if in three generations there is no collapse.</p>

<p>"When the empire is well-ordered, government is not
left in the hands of high officials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
    "When the empire is well-ordered, the common people
will cease to discuss public matters."</p>

<p>"For five generations," he said, "the revenue has departed
from the ducal household. Four generations ago
the government fell into the hands of the high officials.
Hence, alas! the straitened means of the descendants of the
three Hwan families."</p>

<p>"There are," said he, "three kinds of friendships which
are profitable, and three which are detrimental. To make
friends with the upright, with the trustworthy, with the
experienced, is to gain benefit; to make friends with the
subtly perverse, with the artfully pliant, with the subtle in
speech, is detrimental."</p>

<p>Again, "There are three kinds of pleasure which are
profitable, and three which are detrimental. To take pleasure
in going regularly through the various branches of
Ceremonial and Music, in speaking of others' goodness, in
having many worthy wise friends, is profitable. To take
pleasure in wild bold pleasures, in idling carelessly about,
in the too jovial accompaniments of feasting, is detrimental."</p>

<p>Again, "Three errors there be, into which they who wait
upon their superior may fall:&mdash;(1) to speak before the opportunity
comes to them to speak, which I call heedless
haste; (2) refraining from speaking when the opportunity
has come, which I call concealment; and (3) speaking,
regardless of the mood he is in, which I call blindness."</p>

<p>Again, "Three things a superior should guard against:&mdash;(1)
against the lusts of the flesh in his earlier years while
the vital powers are not fully developed and fixed; (2)
against the spirit of combativeness when he has come to
the age of robust manhood and when the vital powers are
matured and strong, and (3) against ambitiousness when
old age has come on and the vital powers have become
weak and decayed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
    "Three things also such a man greatly reveres:&mdash;(1)
the ordinances of Heaven, (2) great men, (3) words of
sages. The inferior man knows not the ordinances of
Heaven and therefore reveres them not, is unduly familiar
in the presence of great men, and scoffs at the words of
sages."</p>

<p>"They whose knowledge comes by birth are of all men
the first in understanding; they to whom it comes by study
are next; men of poor intelectual capacity, who yet study,
may be added as a yet inferior class; and lowest of all are
they who are poor in intellect and never learn."</p>

<p>"Nine things there are of which the superior man should
be mindful:&mdash;to be clear in vision, quick in hearing, genial
in expression, respectful in demeanor, true in word, serious
in duty, inquiring in doubt, firmly self-controlled in anger,
just and fair when the way to success opens out before
him."</p>

<p>"Some have spoken of 'looking upon goodness as upon
something beyond their reach,' and of 'looking upon evil as
like plunging one's hands into scalding liquid';&mdash;I have
seen the men, I have heard the sayings.</p>

<p>"Some, again, have talked of 'living in seclusion to
work out their designs,' and of 'exercising themselves in
righteous living in order to render their principles the more
effective';&mdash;I have heard the sayings, I have not seen the
men."</p>

<p>"Duke King of Ts&lsquo;i had his thousand teams of four, yet
on the day of his death the people had nothing to say of
his goodness. Peh-I and Shuh-Ts&lsquo;i starved at the foot of
Shau-yang, and the people make mention of them to this
day.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'E'en if not wealth thine object be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis all the same, thou'rt changed to me.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Is not this apropos in such cases?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
    Tsz-k&lsquo;in asked of Pih-yu, "Have you heard anything else
peculiar from your father?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," said he. "Once, though, he was standing alone
when I was hurrying past him over the vestibule, and he
said, 'Are you studying the Odes?' 'Not yet,' I replied. 'If
you do not learn the Odes,' said he, 'you will not have the
wherewithal for conversing.' I turned away and studied the
Odes. Another day, when he was again standing alone and
I was hurrying past across the vestibule, he said to me,
'Are you learning the Rules of Propriety?' 'Not yet,' I replied.
'If you have not studied the Rules, you have nothing
to stand upon,' said he. I turned away and studied the
Rules.&mdash;These two things I have heard from him."</p>

<p>Tsz-k&lsquo;in turned away, and in great glee exclaimed, "I
asked one thing, and have got three. I have learnt something
about the Odes, and about the Rules, and moreover
I have learnt how the superior man will turn away his own
son."</p>

<p>The wife of the ruler of a State is called by her husband
"My helpmeet." She speaks of herself as "Your little handmaiden."
The people of that State call her "The prince's
helpmeet," but addressing persons of another State they
speak of her as "Our little princess." When persons of another
State name her they say also "Your prince's helpmeet."</p>

<h2>BOOK XVII</h2>
<h3><i>The Master Induced to Take Office&mdash;Nature and Habit</i></h3>

<p>Yang Ho was desirous of having an interview with Confucius,
but on the latter's failing to go and see him, he
sent a present of a pig to his house. Confucius went to
return his acknowledgments for it at a time when he was
not at home. They met, however, on the way.</p>

<p>He said to Confucius, "Come, I want a word with you.
Can that man be said to have good-will towards his fellow-men
who hugs and hides his own precious gifts and allows
his country to go on in blind error?"</p>

<p>"He cannot," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And can he be said to be wise who, with a liking for
taking part in the public service, is constantly letting slip
his opportunities?"</p>

<p>"He cannot," was the reply again.</p>

<p>"And the days and months are passing; and the years
do not wait for us."</p>

<p>"True," said Confucius; "I will take office."</p>

<p>It was a remark of the Master that while "by nature we
approximate towards each other, by experience we go far
asunder."</p>

<p>Again, "Only the supremely wise and the most deeply
ignorant do not alter."</p>

<p>The Master once, on his arrival at Wu-shing, heard the
sound of stringed instruments and singing. His face
beamed with pleasure, and he said laughingly, "To kill a
cock&mdash;why use an ox-knife?"</p>

<p>Tsz-yu, the governor, replied, "In former days, sir, I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
heard you say, 'Let the superior man learn right principles,
and he will be loving to other men; let the ordinary person
learn right principles, and he will be easily managed.'"</p>

<p>The Master (turning to his disciples) said, "Sirs, what
he says is right: what I said just now was only in play."</p>

<p>Having received an invitation from Kung-shan Fuh-jau,
who was in revolt against the government and was holding
to his district of Pi, the Master showed an inclination to go.</p>

<p>Tsz-lu was averse to this, and said, "You can never go,
that is certain; how should you feel you must go to that
person?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the Master, "he who has invited me must
surely not have done so without a sufficient reason! And if
it should happen that my services were enlisted, I might
create for him another East Chow&mdash;don't you think so?"</p>

<p>Tsz-chang asked Confucius about the virtue of philanthropy.
His answer was, "It is the being able to put in practice
five qualities, in any place under the sun."</p>

<p>"May I ask, please, what these are?" said the disciple.</p>

<p>"They are," he said, "dignity, indulgence, faithfulness,
earnestness, kindness. If you show dignity you will not be
mocked; if you are indulgent you will win the multitude;
if faithful, men will place their trust in you; if earnest, you
will do something meritorious; and if kind, you will be enabled
to avail yourself amply of men's services."</p>

<p>Pih Hih sent the Master an invitation, and he showed an
inclination to go.</p>

<p>Tsz-lu (seeing this) said to him, "In former days, sir, I
have heard you say, 'A superior man will not enter the
society of one who does not that which is good in matters
concerning himself; and this man is in revolt, with Chung-mau
in his possession; if you go to him, how will the case
stand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Master, "those are indeed my words; but
is it not said, 'What is hard may be rubbed without being
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
made thin,' and 'White may be stained without being
made black'?&mdash;I am surely not a gourd! How am I to be
strung up like that kind of thing&mdash;and live without
means?"</p>

<p>"Tsz-lu," said the Master, "you have heard of the six
words with their six obfuscations?"</p>

<p>"No," said he, "not so far."</p>

<p>"Sit down, and I will tell you them. They are these six
virtues, cared for without care for any study about them:&mdash;philanthropy,
wisdom, faithfulness, straightforwardness,
courage, firmness. And the six obfuscations resulting from
not liking to learn about them are, respectively, these:&mdash;fatuity,
mental dissipation, mischievousness, perversity, insubordination,
impetuosity."</p>

<p>"My children," said he once, "why does no one of you
study the Odes?&mdash;They are adapted to rouse the mind, to
assist observation, to make people sociable, to arouse virtuous
indignation. They speak of duties near and far&mdash;the
duty of ministering to a parent, the duty of serving one's
prince; and it is from them that one becomes conversant
with the names of many birds, and beasts, and plants, and
trees."</p>

<p>To his son Pih-yu he said, "Study you the Odes of Chow
and the South, and those of ShÃ¡u and the South. The man
who studies not these is, I should say, somewhat in the
position of one who stands facing a wall!"</p>

<p>"'Etiquette demands it.' 'Etiquette demands it,' so
people plead," said he; "but do not these hankerings after
jewels and silks indeed demand it? Or it is, 'The study of
Music requires it'&mdash;'Music requires it'; but do not these
predilections for bells and drums require it?"</p>

<p>Again, "They who assume an outward appearance of
severity, being inwardly weak, may be likened to low common
men; nay, are they not somewhat like thieves that
break through walls and steal?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
    Again, "The plebeian kind of respect for piety is the
very pest of virtue."</p>

<p>Again, "Listening on the road, and repeating in the
lane&mdash;this is abandonment of virtue."</p>

<p>"Ah, the low-minded creatures!" he exclaimed. "How is
it possible indeed to serve one's prince in their company?
Before they have got what they wanted they are all
anxiety to get it, and after they have got it they are all
anxiety lest they should lose it; and while they are thus full
of concern lest they should lose it, there is no length to
which they will not go."</p>

<p>Again, "In olden times people had three moral infirmities;
which, it may be, are now unknown. Ambitiousness
in those olden days showed itself in momentary outburst;
the ambitiousness of to-day runs riot. Austerity in
those days had its sharp angles; in these it is irritable and
perverse. Feebleness of intellect then was at least straightforward;
in our day it is never aught but deceitful."</p>

<p>Again, "Rarely do we find mutual good feeling where
there is fine speech and studied mien."</p>

<p>Again, "To me it is abhorrent that purple color should
be made to detract from that of vermilion. Also that the
Odes of Ch&lsquo;ing should be allowed to introduce discord in
connection with the music of the Festal Songs and Hymns.
Also that sharp-whetted tongues should be permitted to
subvert governments."</p>

<p>Once said he, "Would that I could dispense with
speech!"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Tsz-kung, "if you were never to speak, what
should your pupils have to hand down from you?"</p>

<p>"Does Heaven ever speak?" said the Master. "The four
seasons come and go, and all creatures live and grow. Does
Heaven indeed speak?"</p>

<p>Once Ju Pi desired an interview with Confucius, from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
which the latter excused himself on the score of ill-health;
but while the attendant was passing out through the doorway
with the message he took his lute and sang, in such a
way as to let him hear him.</p>

<p>Tsai Wo questioned him respecting the three years'
mourning, saying that one full twelve-month was a long
time&mdash;that, if gentlemen were for three years to cease from
observing rules of propriety, propriety must certainly suffer,
and that if for three years they neglected music, music
must certainly die out&mdash;and that seeing nature has taught
us that when the old year's grain is finished the new has
sprung up for us&mdash;seeing also that all the changes
    <a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> in procuring
fire by friction have been gone through in the four
seasons&mdash;surely a twelve-month might suffice.</p>

<p>The Master asked him, "Would it be a satisfaction to
you&mdash;that returning to better food, that putting on of fine
clothes?"</p>

<p>"It would," said he.</p>

<p>"Then if you can be satisfied in so doing, do so. But to a
gentleman, who is in mourning for a parent, the choicest
food will not be palatable, nor will the listening to music
be pleasant, nor will comforts of home make him happy in
mind. Hence he does not do as you suggest. But if you are
now happy in your mind, then do so."</p>

<p>Tsai Wo went out. And the Master went on to say, "It is
want of human feeling in this man. After a child has lived
three years it then breaks away from the tender nursing of
its parents. And this three years' mourning is the customary
mourning prevalent all over the empire. Can this
man have enjoyed the three years of loving care from his
parents?"</p>

<p>"Ah, it is difficult," said he, "to know what to make of
those who are all day long cramming themselves with food
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and are without anything to apply their minds to! Are
there no dice and chess players? Better, perhaps, join in
that pursuit than do nothing at all!"</p>

<p>"Does a gentleman," asked Tsz-lu, "make much account
of bravery?"</p>

<p>"Righteousness he counts higher," said the Master. "A
gentleman who is brave without being just may become
turbulent; while a common person who is brave and not
just may end in becoming a highwayman."</p>

<p>Tsz-kung asked, "I suppose a gentleman will have his
aversions as well as his likings?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Master, "he will dislike those who talk
much about other people's ill-deeds. He will dislike those
who, when occupying inferior places, utter defamatory
words against their superiors. He will dislike those who,
though they may be brave, have no regard for propriety.
And he will dislike those hastily decisive and venturesome
spirits who are nevertheless so hampered by limited intellect."</p>

<p>"And you, too, Tsz-kung," he continued, "have your
aversions, have you not?"</p>

<p>"I dislike," said he, "those plagiarists who wish to pass
for wise persons. I dislike those people who wish their lack
of humility to be taken for bravery. I dislike also those
divulgers of secrets who think to be accounted straightforward."</p>

<p>"Of all others," said the Master, "women-servants and
men-servants are the most difficult people to have the care
of. Approach them in a familiar manner, and they take
liberties; keep them at a distance, and they grumble."</p>

<p>Again, "When a man meets with odium at forty, he will
do so to the end."</p>

<h2>BOOK XVIII</h2>
<h3><i>Good Men in Seclusion&mdash;Duke of Chow to His Son</i></h3>

<p>"In the reign of the last king of the Yin dynasty," Confucius
said, "there were three men of philanthropic spirit:&mdash;the
viscount of Wei, who withdrew from him; the viscount
of Ki, who became his bondsman; and Pi-kan, who
reproved him and suffered death."</p>

<p>HwÃºi of Liu-hiÃ¡, who filled the office of Chief Criminal
Judge, was thrice dismissed. A person remarked to him,
"Can you not yet bear to withdraw?" He replied, "If I act
in a straightforward way in serving men, whither in these
days should I go, where I should not be thrice dismissed?
Were I to adopt crooked ways in their service, why need
I leave the land where my parents dwell?"</p>

<p>Duke King of Ts&lsquo;i remarked respecting his attitude towards
Confucius, "If he is to be treated like the Chief of
the Ki family, I cannot do it. I should treat him as somewhere
between the Ki and Mang Chiefs.&mdash;I am old," he
added, "and not competent to avail myself of him."</p>

<p>Confucius, hearing of this, went away.</p>

<p>The Ts&lsquo;i officials presented to the Court of Lu a number
of female musicians. Ki Hwan accepted them, and for
three days no Court was held.</p>

<p>Confucius went away.</p>

<p>Tsieh-yu, the madman<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> of Ts&lsquo;u, was once passing Confucius,
singing as he went along. He sang&mdash;</p>

<p>Confucius alighted, wishing to enter into conversation
with him; but the man hurried along and left him, and
he was therefore unable to get a word with him.</p>

<p>Ch&lsquo;ang-tsÃ¼ and Kieh-nih<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> were working together on
some ploughed land. Confucius was passing by them, and
sent Tsz-lu to ask where the ford was.</p>

<p>Ch&lsquo;ang-tsÃ¼ said, "Who is the person driving the carriage?"</p>

<p>"Confucius," answered Tsz-lu.</p>

<p>"He of Lu?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The same," said Tsz-lu.</p>

<p>"He knows then where the ford is," said he.</p>

<p>Tsz-lu then put his question to Kieh-nih; and the latter
asked, "Who are you?"</p>

<p>Tsz-lu gave his name.</p>

<p>"You are a follower of Confucius of Lu, are you not?"</p>

<p>"You are right," he answered.</p>

<p>"Ah, as these waters rise and overflow their bounds,"
said he, "'tis so with all throughout the empire; and who
is he that can alter the state of things? And you are a follower
of a learned man who withdraws from his chief;
had you not better be a follower of such as have forsaken
the world?" And he went on with his harrowing, without
stopping.</p>

<p>Tsz-lu went and informed his Master of all this. He was
deeply touched, and said, "One cannot herd on equal terms
with beasts and birds: if I am not to live among these human
folk, then with whom else should I live? Only when
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the empire is well ordered shall I cease to take part in the
work of reformation."</p>

<p>Tsz-lu was following the Master, but had dropped behind
on the way, when he encountered an old man with a
weed-basket slung on a staff over his shoulder. Tsz-lu inquired
of him, "Have you seen my Master, sir?" Said the
old man, "Who is your master?&mdash;you who never employ
your four limbs in laborious work; you who do not know
one from another of the five sorts of grain!" And he stuck
his staff in the ground, and began his weeding.</p>

<p>Tsz-lu brought his hands together on his breast and
stood still.</p>

<p>The old man kept Tsz-lu and lodged him for the night,
killed a fowl and prepared some millet, entertained him,
and brought his two sons out to see him.</p>

<p>On the morrow Tsz-lu went on his way, and told all
this to the Master, who said, "He is a recluse," and sent
Tsz-lu back to see him again. But by the time he got there
he was gone.</p>

<p>Tsz-lu remarked upon this, "It is not right he should
evade official duties. If he cannot allow any neglect of the
terms on which elders and juniors should live together,
how is it that he neglects to conform to what is proper as
between prince and public servant? He wishes for himself
personally a pure life, yet creates disorder in that more important
relationship. When a gentleman undertakes public
work, he will carry out the duties proper to it; and he
knows beforehand that right principles may not win their
way."</p>

<p>Among those who have retired from public life have
been Peh-I and Shuh-Ts&lsquo;i, Yu-chung, I-yih, Chu-chang,
HwÃºi of Liu-hiÃ¡, and ShÃ¡u-lien.</p>

<p>"Of these," said the Master, "Peh-I and Shuh-Ts&lsquo;i may
be characterized, I should say, as men who never declined
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
from their high resolve nor soiled themselves by aught of
disgrace.</p>

<p>"Of HwÃºi of Liu-hiÃ¡ and ShÃ¡u-lien, if one may say that
they did decline from high resolve, and that they did bring
disgrace upon themselves, yet their words were consonant
with established principles, and their action consonant
with men's thoughts and wishes; and this is all that may
be said of them.</p>

<p>"Of Yu-chung and I-yih, if it be said that when they retired
into privacy they let loose their tongues, yet in their
aim at personal purity of life they succeeded, and their
defection was also successful in its influence.</p>

<p>"My own rule is different from any adopted by these:
I will take no liberties, I will have no curtailing of my
liberty."</p>

<p>The chief music-master went off to Ts&lsquo;i. Kan, the conductor
of the music at the second repast, went over to
Ts&lsquo;u. LiÃ¡u, conductor at the third repast, went over to
Ts&lsquo;ai. And Kiueh, who conducted at the fourth, went to
Ts&lsquo;in.</p>

<p>Fang-shuh, the drummer, withdrew into the neighborhood
of the Ho. Wu the tambourer went to the Han. And
Yang the junior music-master, and Siang who played on
the musical stone, went to the sea-coast.</p>

<p>Anciently the Duke of Chow, addressing his son the
Duke of Lu, said, "A good man in high place is not indifferent
about the members of his own family, and does
not give occasion to the chief ministers to complain that
they are not employed; nor without great cause will he set
aside old friendships; nor does he seek for full equipment
for every kind of service in any single man."</p>

<p>There were once eight officials during this Chow dynasty,
who were four pairs of twins, all brothers&mdash;the eldest
pair Tah and Kwoh, the next Tuh and Hwuh, the third
YÃ© and HiÃ¡, the youngest Sui and Kwa.</p>

<h2>BOOK XIX</h2>
<h3><i>Teachings of Various Chief Disciples</i></h3>

<p>"The learned official," said Tsz-chang, "who when he
sees danger ahead will risk his very life, who when he sees
a chance of success is mindful of what is just and proper,
who in his religious acts is mindful of the duty of reverence,
and when in mourning thinks of his loss, is indeed a
fit and proper person for his place."</p>

<p>Again he said, "If a person hold to virtue but never advance
in it, and if he have faith in right principles and do
not build himself up in them, how can he be regarded
either as having such, or as being without them?"</p>

<p>Tsz-hiÃ¡'s disciples asked Tsz-chang his views about intercourse
with others. "What says your Master?" he rejoined.
"He says," they replied, "'Associate with those who
are qualified, and repel from you such as are not.'" Tsz-chang
then said, "That is different from what I have learnt.
A superior man esteems the worthy and wise, and bears
with all. He makes much of the good and capable, and
pities the incapable. Am I eminently worthy and wise?&mdash;who
is there then among men whom I will not bear with?
Am I not worthy and wise?&mdash;others will be minded to
repel me: I have nothing to do with repelling them."</p>

<p>Sayings of Tsz-hiÃ¡:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Even in inferior pursuits there must be something
worthy of contemplation, but if carried to an extreme there
is danger of fanaticism; hence the superior man does not
engage in them.</p>

<p>"The student who daily recognizes how much he yet
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
lacks, and as the months pass forgets not what he has succeeded
in learning, may undoubtedly be called a lover of
learning.</p>

<p>"Wide research and steadfast purpose, eager questioning
and close reflection&mdash;all this tends to humanize a man.</p>

<p>"As workmen spend their time in their workshops for
the perfecting of their work, so superior men apply their
minds to study in order to make themselves thoroughly
conversant with their subjects.</p>

<p>"When an inferior man does a wrong thing, he is sure to
gloss it over.</p>

<p>"The superior man is seen in three different aspects:&mdash;look
at him from a distance, he is imposing in appearance;
approach him, he is gentle and warm-hearted; hear him
speak, he is acute and strict.</p>

<p>"Let such a man have the people's confidence, and he
will get much work out of them; so long, however, as he
does not possess their confidence they will regard him as
grinding them down.</p>

<p>"When confidence is reposed in him, he may then with
impunity administer reproof; so long as it is not, he will be
regarded as a detractor.</p>

<p>"Where there is no over-stepping of barriers in the practice
of the higher virtues, there may be freedom to pass in
and out in the practice of the lower ones."</p>

<p>Tsz-yu had said, "The pupils in the school of Tsz-hiÃ¡ are
good enough at such things as sprinkling and scrubbing
floors, answering calls and replying to questions from superiors,
and advancing and retiring to and from such; but
these things are only offshoots&mdash;as to the root of things
they are nowhere. What is the use of all that?"</p>

<p>When this came to the ears of Tsz-hiÃ¡, he said, "Ah!
there he is mistaken. What does a master, in his methods
of teaching, consider first in his precepts? And what does
he account next, as that about which he may be indifferent?
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
It is like as in the study of plants&mdash;classification by
<i>differentiÃ¦</i>. How may a master play fast and loose in his
methods of instruction? Would they not indeed be sages,
who could take in at once the first principles and the final
developments of things?"</p>

<p>Further observations of Tsz-hiÃ¡:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the public service devote what energy and time remain
to study. After study devote what energy and time
remain to the public service.</p>

<p>"As to the duties of mourning, let them cease when the
grief is past.</p>

<p>"My friend Tsz-chang, although he has the ability to
tackle hard things, has not yet the virtue of philanthropy."</p>

<p>The learned Tsang observed, "How loftily Tsz-chang
bears himself! Difficult indeed along with him to practise
philanthropy!"</p>

<p>Again he said, "I have heard this said by the Master,
that 'though men may not exert themselves to the utmost
in other duties, yet surely in the duty of mourning for their
parents they will do so!'"</p>

<p>Again, "This also I have heard said by the Master: 'The
filial piety of Mang Chwang in other respects might be
equalled, but as manifested in his making no changes
among his father's ministers, nor in his father's mode of
government&mdash;that aspect of it could not easily be
equalled.'"</p>

<p>Yang Fu, having been made senior Criminal Judge by
the Chief of the Mang clan, consulted with the learned
Tsang. The latter advised him as follows: "For a long time
the Chiefs have failed in their government, and the people
have become unsettled. When you arrive at the facts of
their cases, do not rejoice at your success in that, but
rather be sorry for them, and have pity upon them."</p>

<p>Tsz-kung once observed, "We speak of 'the iniquity of
ChÃ¡u'&mdash;but 'twas not so great as this." And so it is that the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
superior man is averse from settling in this sink, into which
everything runs that is foul in the empire.</p>

<p>Again he said, "Faults in a superior man are like eclipses
of the sun or moon: when he is guilty of a trespass men all
see it; and when he is himself again, all look up to him."</p>

<p>Kung-sun Ch&lsquo;au of Wei inquired of Tsz-kung how Confucius
acquired his learning.</p>

<p>Tsz-kung replied, "The teachings of Wan and Wu have
not yet fallen to the ground. They exist in men. Worthy
and wise men have the more important of these stored up
in their minds; and others, who are not such, store up the
less important of them; and as no one is thus without the
teachings of Wan and Wu, how should our Master not
have learned? And moreover what permanent preceptor
could he have?"</p>

<p>Shuh-sun Wu-shuh, addressing the high officials at the
Court, remarked that Tsz-kung was a greater worthy than
Confucius.</p>

<p>Tsz-fuh King-pih went and informed Tsz-kung of this
remark.</p>

<p>Tsz-kung said, "Take by way of comparison the walls
outside our houses. My wall is shoulder-high, and you may
look over it and see what the house and its contents are
worth. My Master's wall is tens of feet high, and unless you
should effect an entrance by the door, you would fail to behold
the beauty of the ancestral hall and the rich array of
all its officers. And they who effect an entrance by the
door, methinks, are few! Was it not, however, just like him&mdash;that
remark of the Chief?"</p>

<p>Shuh-sun Wu-shuh had been casting a slur on the character
of Confucius.</p>

<p>"No use doing that," said Tsz-kung; "he is irreproachable.
The wisdom and worth of other men are little hills
and mounds of earth: traversible. He is the sun, or the
moon, impossible to reach and pass. And what harm, I ask,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
can a man do to the sun or the moon, by wishing to intercept
himself from either? It all shows that he knows not
how to gauge capacity."</p>

<p>Tsz-k&lsquo;in, addressing Tsz-kung, said, "You depreciate
yourself. Confucius is surely not a greater worthy than
yourself."</p>

<p>Tsz-kung replied, "In the use of words one ought never
to be incautious; because a gentleman for one single utterance
of his is apt to be considered a wise man, and for a
single utterance may be accounted unwise. No more might
one think of attaining to the Master's perfections than
think of going upstairs to Heaven! Were it ever his fortune
to be at the head of the government of a country,
then that which is spoken of as 'establishing the country'
would be establishment indeed; he would be its guide and
it would follow him, he would tranquillize it and it would
render its willing homage: he would give forward impulses
to it to which it would harmoniously respond. In his life he
would be its glory, at his death there would be great lamentation.
How indeed could such as he be equalled?"</p>

<h3><i>Extracts from the Book of History</i></h3>

<p>The Emperor Yau said to Shun, "Ah, upon you, upon your
person, lies the Heaven-appointed order of succession!
Faithfully hold to it, without any deflection; for if within
the four seas necessity and want befall the people, your
own revenue will forever come to an end."</p>

<p>Shun also used the same language in handing down the
appointment to Yu.</p>

<p>The Emperor T&lsquo;ang in his prayer, said, "I, the child Li,
presume to avail me of an ox of dusky hue, and presume to
manifestly announce to Thee, O God, the most high and
Sovereign Potentate, that to the transgressor I dare not
grant forgiveness, nor yet keep in abeyance Thy ministers.
Judgment rests in Thine heart, O God. Should we ourself
transgress, may the guilt not be visited everywhere upon
all. Should the people all transgress, be the guilt upon ourself!"</p>

<p>Chow possessed great gifts, by which the able and good
were richly endowed.</p>

<p>"Although," said King Wu, "he is surrounded by his near
relatives, they are not to be compared with men of humane
spirit. The people are suffering wrongs, and the remedy
rests with me&mdash;the one man."</p>

<p>After Wu had given diligent attention to the various
weights and measures, examined the laws and regulations,
and restored the degraded officials, good government
everywhere ensued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
    He caused ruined States to flourish again, reinstated intercepted
heirs, and promoted to office men who had gone
into retirement; and the hearts of the people throughout
the empire drew towards him.</p>

<p>Among matters of prime consideration with him were
these&mdash;food for the people, the duty of mourning, and sacrificial
offerings to the departed.</p>

<p>He was liberal and large-hearted, and so won all hearts;
true, and so was trusted by the people; energetic, and thus
became a man of great achievements; just in his rule, and
all were well content.</p>

<p>Tsz-chang in a conversation with Confucius asked,
"What say you is essential for the proper conduct of government?"</p>

<p>The Master replied, "Let the ruler hold in high estimation
the five excellences, and eschew the four evils; then
may he conduct his government properly."</p>

<p>"And what call you the five excellences?" he was asked.</p>

<p>"They are," he said, "bounty without extravagance;
burdening without exciting discontent; desire without
covetousness; dignity without haughtiness; show of majesty
without fierceness."</p>

<p>"What mean you," asked Tsz-chang, "by bounty without
extravagance?"</p>

<p>"Is it not this," he replied&mdash;"to make that which is of
benefit to the people still more beneficial? When he selects
for them such labors as it is possible for them to do,
and exacts them, who will then complain? So when his desire
is the virtue of humaneness, and he attains it, how
shall he then be covetous? And if&mdash;whether he have to
do with few or with many, with small or with great&mdash;he
do not venture ever to be careless, is not this also to have
dignity without haughtiness? And if&mdash;when properly
vested in robe and cap, and showing dignity in his every
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
look&mdash;his appearance be so imposing that the people look
up to and stand in awe of him, is not this moreover to show
majesty without fierceness?"</p>

<p>"What, then, do you call the four evils?" said Tsz-chang.</p>

<p>The answer here was, "Omitting to instruct the people
and then inflicting capital punishment on them&mdash;which
means cruel tyranny. Omitting to give them warning and
yet looking for perfection in them&mdash;which means oppression.
Being slow and late in issuing requisitions, and exacting
strict punctuality in the returns&mdash;which means robbery.
And likewise, in intercourse with men, to expend
and to receive in a stingy manner&mdash;which is to act the
part of a mere commissioner."</p>

<p>"None can be a superior man," said the Master, "who
does not recognize the decrees of Heaven.</p>

<p>"None can have stability in him without a knowledge of
the proprieties.</p>

<p>"None can know a man without knowing his utterances."</p>

<h1>THE SAYINGS<br />
OF MENCIUS</h1>
<h2>[<i>Translated into English by James Legge</i>]</h2>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>A hundred years after the time of Confucius the Chinese
nation seemed to have fallen back into their original condition
of lawlessness and oppression. The King's power
and authority was laughed to scorn, the people were pillaged
by the feudal nobility, and famine reigned in many
districts. The foundations of truth and social order seemed
to be overthrown. There were teachers of immorality
abroad, who published the old Epicurean doctrine, "Let us
eat and drink, for to-morrow we die." This teaching was
accompanied by a spirit of cold-blooded egotism which
extinguished every spark of Confucian altruism. Even the
pretended disciples of Confucius confused the precepts of
the Master, and by stripping them of their narrow significance
rendered them nugatory. It was at this point that
Mang-tsze, "Mang the philosopher," arose. He was sturdy
in bodily frame, vigorous in mind, profound in political
sagacity and utterly fearless in denouncing the errors of
his countrymen. He had been brought up among the disciples
of Confucius, in whose province he was born <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
372, but he was much more active and aggressive, less a
Mystic than a fanatic, in comparison with his Master. He
resolved on active measures in stemming the tendency of
his day. He did indeed surround himself with a school of
disciples, but instead of making a series of desultory
travels, teaching in remote places and along the high-road,
he went to the heart of the evil. He presented himself like
a second John the Baptist at the courts of kings and
princes, and there boldly denounced vice and misrule. It
was not difficult for a Chinese scholar and teacher to find
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
access to the highest of the land. The Chinese believed in
the divine right of learning, just as they believed in the
divine right of kings. Mang employed every weapon of
persuasion in trying to combat heresy and oppression;
alternately ridiculing and reproving: now appealing in a
burst of moral enthusiasm, and now denouncing in terms
of cutting sarcasm the abuses which after all he failed to
check. The last prince whom he successfully confronted
was the Marquis of Lu, who turned him carelessly away.
He accepted this as the Divine sentence of his failure,
"That I have not found in this marquis, a ruler who would
hearken to me is an intimation of heaven." Henceforth he
lived in retirement until his ninety-seventh year; but from
his apparent failure sprang a practical success. His written
teachings are amongst the most lively and epigrammatic
works of Chinese literature, have done much to keep alive
amongst his countrymen the spirit of Confucianism, and
even Western readers may drink wisdom from this spring
of Oriental lore. The following selections from his sayings
well exhibit the spirit of his system of philosophy and
morality:</p>

<h2>BOOK I</h2>
<h3><i>King Hwuy of LÃ«ang</i></h3>
<h4>PART I</h4>

<p>Mencius went to see King Hwuy of LÃ«ang.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The king said,
"Venerable Sir, since you have not counted it far to come
here a distance of a thousand li, may I presume that you
are likewise provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?"
Mencius replied, "Why must your Majesty use
that word 'profit'? What I am likewise provided with are
counsels to benevolence and righteousness; and these are
my only topics.</p>

<p>"If your Majesty say, 'What is to be done to profit my
kingdom?' the great officers will say, 'What is to be done to
profit our families?' and the inferior officers and the common
people will say, 'What is to be done to profit our persons?'
Superiors and inferiors will try to take the profit the
one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered.
In the kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer
of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a thousand
chariots. In the State of a thousand chariots, the murderer
of his ruler will be the chief of a family of a hundred
chariots. To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred
in a thousand, cannot be regarded as not a large allowance;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
but if righteousness be put last and profit first,
they will not be satisfied without snatching all.</p>

<p>"There never was a man trained to benevolence who
neglected his parents. There never was a man trained to
righteousness who made his ruler an after consideration.
Let your Majesty likewise make benevolence and righteousness
your only themes&mdash;Why must you speak of
profit?"</p>

<p>When Mencius, another day, was seeing King Hwuy of
LÃ«ang, the King went and stood with him by a pond, and,
looking round on the wild geese and deer, large and small,
said, "Do wise and good princes also take pleasure in these
things?" Mencius replied, "Being wise and good, they then
have pleasure in these things. If they are not wise and
good, though they have these things, they do not find
pleasure." It is said in the 'Book of Poetry':&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When he planned the commencement of the Marvellous tower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He planned it, and defined it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the people in crowds undertook the work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in no time completed it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he planned the commencement, he said, "Be not in a hurry."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the people came as if they were his children.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king was in the Marvellous park,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the does were lying down&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The does so sleek and fat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the white birds glistening.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king was by the Marvellous pond;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How full was it of fishes leaping about!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>King Wan used the strength of the people to make his
tower and pond, and the people rejoiced to do the work,
calling the tower 'the Marvellous Tower,' and the pond
'the Marvellous Pond,' and being glad that he had his deer,
his fishes and turtles. The ancients caused their people to
have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they
could enjoy it.</p>

<p>"In the Declaration of T&lsquo;ang it is said, 'O Sun, when wilt
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
thou expire? We will die together with thee.' The people
wished for KÃ«eh's death, though they should die with him.
Although he had his tower, his pond, birds and animals,
how could he have pleasure alone?"</p>

<p>King Hwuy of LÃ«ang said, "Small as my virtue is, in the
government of my kingdom, I do indeed exert my mind to
the utmost. If the year be bad inside the Ho, I remove as
many of the people as I can to the east of it, and convey
grain to the country inside. If the year be bad on the east
of the river, I act on the same plan. On examining the governmental
methods of the neighboring kingdoms, I do not
find there is any ruler who exerts his mind as I do. And yet
the people of the neighboring kings do not decrease, nor
do my people increase&mdash;how is this?"</p>

<p>Mencius replied, "Your Majesty loves war; allow me to
take an illustration from war. The soldiers move forward
at the sound of the drum; and when the edges of their
weapons have been crossed, on one side, they throw
away their buff coats, trail their weapons behind them,
and run. Some run a hundred paces and then stop; some
run fifty paces and stop. What would you think if these,
because they had run but fifty paces, should laugh at those
who ran a hundred paces?" The king said, "They cannot
do so. They only did not run a hundred paces; but they
also ran." Mencius said, "Since your Majesty knows this
you have no ground to expect that your people will become
more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms.</p>

<p>"If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the
grain will be more than can be eaten. If close nets are not
allowed to enter the pools and ponds, the fish and turtles
will be more than can be consumed. If the axes and bills
enter the hill-forests only at the proper times, the wood
will be more than can be used. When the grain and fish
and turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
wood than can be used, this enables the people to nourish
their living and do all offices for their dead, without any
feeling against any. But this condition, in which the people
nourish their living, and do all offices to their dead without
having any feeling against any, is the first step in the Royal
way.</p>

<p>"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads
with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able
to wear silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let
not their time of breeding be neglected, and persons of
seventy years will be able to eat flesh. Let there not be
taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of
the field allotment of a hundred acres, and the family of
several mouths will not suffer from hunger. Let careful attention
be paid to the teaching in the various schools, with
repeated inculcation of the filial and fraternal duties, and
gray-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying
burdens on their backs or on their heads. It has never been
that the ruler of a State where these results were seen,
persons of seventy wearing silk and eating flesh, and the
black-haired people suffering neither from hunger nor
cold, did not attain to the Royal dignity.</p>

<p>"Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do
not know to store up of the abundance. There are people
dying from famine on the roads, and you do not know to
issue your stores for their relief. When men die, you say,
'It is not owing to me; it is owing to the year.' In what does
this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then
saying, 'It was not I; it was the weapon'? Let your Majesty
cease to lay the blame on the year and instantly the people,
all under the sky, will come to you."</p>

<p>King Hwuy of LÃ«ang said, "I wish quietly to receive
your instructions." Mencius replied, "Is there any difference
between killing a man with a stick and with a
sword?" "There is no difference," was the answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
    Mencius continued, "Is there any difference between
doing it with a sword and with governmental measures?"
"There is not," was the answer again.</p>

<p>Mencius then said, "In your stalls there are fat beasts;
in your stables there are fat horses. But your people have
the look of hunger, and in the fields there are those who
have died of famine. This is leading on beasts to devour
men. Beasts devour one another, and men hate them for
doing so. When he who is called the parent of the people
conducts his government so as to be chargeable with leading
on beasts to devour men, where is that parental relation
to the people? Chung-ne said, 'Was he not without
posterity who first made wooden images to bury with the
dead?' So he said, because that man made the semblances
of men and used them for that purpose; what shall be
thought of him who causes his people to die of hunger?"</p>

<p>King Hwuy of LÃ«ang said, "There was not in the kingdom
a stronger State than Ts&lsquo;in, as you, venerable Sir,
know. But since it descended to me, on the east we were
defeated by Ts&lsquo;e, and then my eldest son perished; on the
west we lost seven hundred li of territory to Ts&lsquo;in; and on
the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Ts&lsquo;oo.
I have brought shame on my departed predecessors, and
wish on their account to wipe it away once for all. What
course is to be pursued to accomplish this?"</p>

<p>Mencius replied, "With a territory only a hundred li
square it has been possible to obtain the Royal dignity. If
your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government
to the people, being sparing in the use of punishments
and fines, and making the taxes and levies of produce
light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed
deep, and the weeding well attended to, and that the able-bodied,
during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their
filial piety, fraternal duty, faithfulness, and truth, serving
thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
abroad, their elders and superiors, you will then have a
people who can be employed with sticks which they have
prepared to oppose the strong buff-coats and sharp weapons
of the troops of Ts&lsquo;in and Ts&lsquo;oo.</p>

<p>"The rulers of those States rob their people of their time,
so that they cannot plough and weed their fields in order
to support their parents. Parents suffer from cold and hunger;
elder and younger brothers, wives and children, are
separated and scattered abroad. Those rulers drive their
people into pitfalls or into the water; and your Majesty will
go to punish them. In such a case, who will oppose your
Majesty? In accordance with this is the saying, 'The benevolent
has no enemy!' I beg your Majesty not to doubt
what I said."</p>

<p>Mencius had an interview with King SÃ«ang<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> of LÃ«ang.
When he came out he said to some persons, "When I
looked at him from a distance, he did not appear like a
ruler; when I drew near to him, I saw nothing venerable
about him. Abruptly he asked me, 'How can the kingdom,
all under the sky, be settled?' I replied, 'It will be settled
by being united under one sway.'</p>

<p>"'Who can so unite it?' he asked.</p>

<p>"I replied, 'He who has no pleasure in killing men can
so unite it.'</p>

<p>"'Who can give it to him?' he asked.</p>

<p>"I replied, 'All under heaven will give it to him. Does
your Majesty know the way of the growing grain? During
the seventh and eighth months, when drought prevails,
the plants become dry. Then the clouds collect densely in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the heavens, and send down torrents of rain, so that the
grain erects itself as if by a shoot. When it does so, who
can keep it back? Now among those who are shepherds of
men throughout the kingdom, there is not one who does
not find pleasure in killing men. If there were one who did
not find pleasure in killing men, all the people under the
sky would be looking towards him with outstretched
necks. Such being indeed the case, the people would go to
him as water flows downwards with a rush, which no one
can repress."</p>

<p>King Seuen of Ts&lsquo;e asked, saying, "May I be informed by
you of the transactions of Hwan of Ts&lsquo;e and Wan of Ts&lsquo;in?"</p>

<p>Mencius replied, "There were none of the disciples of
Chung-ne who spoke about the affairs of Hwan and Wan,
and therefore they have not been transmitted to these
after-ages; your servant has not heard of them. If you will
have me speak, let it be about the principles of attaining
to the Royal sway."</p>

<p>The king said, "Of what kind must his virtue be who can
attain to the Royal sway?" Mencius said, "If he loves and
protects the people, it is impossible to prevent him from
attaining it."</p>

<p>The king said, "Is such an one as poor I competent to
love and protect the people?" "Yes," was the reply. "From
what do you know that I am competent to that?" "I have
heard," said Mencius, "from Hoo Heih the following incident:&mdash;'The
king,' said he, 'was sitting aloft in the hall,
when some people appeared leading a bull past below it.
The king saw it, and asked where the bull was going, and
being answered that they were going to consecrate a bell
with its blood, he said, "Let it go, I cannot bear its frightened
appearance&mdash;as if it were an innocent person going
to the place of death." They asked in reply whether, if
they did so, they should omit the consecration of the bell,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
but the king said, "How can that be omitted? Change it
for a sheep." "I do not know whether this incident occurred."</p>

<p>"It did," said the king, and Mencius replied, "The heart
seen in this is sufficient to carry you to the Royal sway. The
people all supposed that your Majesty grudged the animal,
but your servant knows surely that it was your Majesty's
not being able to bear the sight of the creature's distress
which made you do as you did."</p>

<p>The king said, "You are right; and yet there really was
an appearance of what the people imagined. But though
Ts&lsquo;e be narrow and small, how should I grudge a bull? Indeed
it was because I could not bear its frightened appearance,
as if it were an innocent person going to the place of
death, that therefore I changed it for a sheep."</p>

<p>Mencius said, "Let not your Majesty deem it strange
that the people should think you grudged the animal.
When you changed a large one for a small, how should
they know the true reason? If you felt pained by its being
led without any guilt to the place of death, what was there
to choose between a bull and a sheep?" The king laughed
and said, "What really was my mind in the matter? I did
not grudge the value of the bull, and yet I changed it for
a sheep! There was reason in the people's saying that I
grudged the creature."</p>

<p>Mencius said, "There is no harm in their saying so. It
was an artifice of benevolence. You saw the bull, and had
not seen the sheep. So is the superior man affected towards
animals, that, having seen them alive, he cannot
bear to see them die, and, having heard their dying cries,
he cannot bear to eat their flesh. On this account he keeps
away from his stalls and kitchen."</p>

<p>The king was pleased and said, "The Ode says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'What other men have in their minds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can measure by reflection.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
    This might be spoken of you, my Master. I indeed did the
thing, but when I turned my thoughts inward and sought
for it, I could not discover my own mind. When you,
Master, spoke those words, the movements of compassion
began to work in my mind. But how is it that this heart has
in it what is equal to the attainment of the Royal sway?"</p>

<p>Mencius said, "Suppose a man were to make this statement
to your Majesty, 'My strength is sufficient to lift three
thousand catties, but is not sufficient to lift one feather;
my eyesight is sharp enough to examine the point of an
autumn hair, but I do not see a wagon-load of fagots,'
would your Majesty allow what he said?" "No," was the
king's remark, and Mencius proceeded, "Now here is kindness
sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no benefits are
extended from it to the people&mdash;how is this? is an exception
to be made here? The truth is, the feather's not being
lifted is because the strength was not used; the wagon-load
of firewood's not being seen is because the eyesight was
not used; and the people's not being loved and protected
is because the kindness is not used. Therefore your Majesty's
not attaining to the Royal sway is because you do
not do it, and not because you are not able to do it."</p>

<p>The king asked, "How may the difference between him
who does not do a thing and him who is not able to do it be
graphically set forth?" Mencius replied, "In such a thing
as taking the T&lsquo;ae mountain under your arm, and leaping
with it over the North Sea, if you say to people, 'I am not
able to do it,' that is a real case of not being able. In such
a matter as breaking off a branch from a tree at the order
of a superior, if you say to people, 'I am not able to do it,'
it is not a case of not being able to do it. And so your
Majesty's not attaining to the Royal sway is not such a case
as that of taking the T&lsquo;ae mountain under your arm and
leaping over the North Sea with it; but it is a case like that
of breaking off a branch from a tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
    "Treat with reverence due to age the elders in your own
family, so that those in the families of others shall be similarly
treated; treat with the kindness due to youth the
young in your own family, so that those in the families of
others shall be similarly treated&mdash;do this and the kingdom
may be made to go round in your palm. It is said in the
'Book of Poetry,'</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'His example acted on his wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extended to his brethren,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was felt by all the clans and States;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>telling us how King Wan simply took this kindly heart, and
exercised it towards those parties. Therefore the carrying
out of the feeling of kindness by a ruler will suffice for the
love and protection of all within the four seas; and if he
do not carry it out, he will not be able to protect his wife
and children. The way in which the ancients came greatly
to surpass other men was no other than this, that they carried
out well what they did, so as to affect others. Now
your kindness is sufficient to reach to animals, and yet no
benefits are extended from it to the people. How is this?
Is an exception to be made here?</p>

<p>"By weighing we know what things are light, and what
heavy. By measuring we know what things are long, and
what short. All things are so dealt with, and the mind requires
specially to be so. I beg your Majesty to measure it.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty collects your equipments of war, endangers
your soldiers and officers and excites the resentment
of the various princes&mdash;do these things cause you
pleasure in your mind?"</p>

<p>The king said, "No. How should I derive pleasure from
these things? My object in them is to seek for what I
greatly desire."</p>

<p>Mencius said, "May I hear from you what it is that your
Majesty greatly desires?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
    The king laughed, and did not speak. Mencius resumed,
"Are you led to desire it because you have not enough of
rice and sweet food for your mouth? or because you have
not enough of light and warm clothing for your body? or
because you have not enough of beautifully colored objects
to satisfy your eyes? or because there are not voices
and sounds enough to fill your ears? or because you have
not enough of attendants and favorites to stand before you
and receive your orders? Your Majesty's various officers
are sufficient to supply you with all these things. How can
your Majesty have such a desire on account of them?"
"No," said the king, "my desire is not on account of them."
Mencius observed, "Then what your Majesty greatly desires
can be known. You desire to enlarge your territories,
to have Ts&lsquo;in and Ts&lsquo;oo coming to your court, to rule the
Middle States, and to attract to you the barbarous tribes
that surround them. But to do what you do in order to seek
for what you desire is like climbing a tree to seek for fish."</p>

<p>"Is it so bad as that?" said the king. "I apprehend it is
worse," was the reply. "If you climb a tree to seek for fish,
although you do not get the fish, you have no subsequent
calamity. But if you do what you do in order to seek for
what you desire, doing it even with all your heart, you will
assuredly afterwards meet with calamities." The king said,
"May I hear what they will be?" Mencius replied, "If the
people of Tsow were fighting with the people of Ts&lsquo;oo,
which of them does your Majesty think would conquer?"
"The people of Ts&lsquo;oo would conquer," was the answer, and
Mencius pursued, "So then, a small State cannot contend
with a great, few cannot contend with many, nor can the
weak contend with the strong. The territory within the
seas would embrace nine divisions, each of a thousand li
square. All Ts&lsquo;e together is one of them. If with one part
you try to subdue the other eight, what is the difference
between that and Tsow's contending with Ts&lsquo;oo? With the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
desire which you have, you must turn back to the proper
course for its attainment.</p>

<p>"Now, if your Majesty will institute a government whose
action shall all be benevolent, this will cause all the officers
in the kingdom to wish to stand in your Majesty's court,
the farmers all to wish to plough in your Majesty's fields,
the merchants, both travelling and stationary, all to wish to
store their goods in your Majesty's market-places, travellers
and visitors all to wish to travel on your Majesty's
roads, and all under heaven who feel aggrieved by their
rulers to wish to come and complain to your Majesty.
When they are so bent, who will be able to keep them
back?"</p>

<p>The king said, "I am stupid and cannot advance to this.
But I wish you, my Master, to assist my intentions. Teach
me clearly, and although I am deficient in intelligence and
vigor, I should like to try at least to institute such a government."</p>

<p>Mencius replied, "They are only men of education, who,
without a certain livelihood, are able to maintain a fixed
heart. As to the people, if they have not a certain livelihood,
they will be found not to have a fixed heart. And if
they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which they
will not do in the way of self-abandonment, of moral deflection,
of depravity, and of wild license. When they
have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and
punish them, is to entrap the people. How can such a
thing as entrapping the people be done under the rule of
a benevolent man?"</p>

<p>"Therefore, an intelligent ruler will regulate the livelihood
of the people, so as to make sure that, above, they
shall have sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and
below, sufficient wherewith to support their wives and
children; that in good years they shall always be abundantly
satisfied, and that in bad years they shall not be in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
danger of perishing. After this he may urge them, and they
will proceed to what is good, for in this case the people
will follow after that with readiness.</p>

<p>"But now the livelihood of the people is so regulated,
that, above, they have not sufficient wherewith to serve
their parents, and, below, they have not sufficient wherewith
to support their wives and children; even in good
years their lives are always embittered, and in bad years
they are in danger of perishing. In such circumstances
their only object is to escape from death, and they are
afraid they will not succeed in doing so&mdash;what leisure have
they to cultivate propriety and righteousness?</p>

<p>"If your Majesty wishes to carry out a benevolent government,
why not turn back to what is the essential step
to its attainment?</p>

<p>"Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads
with their five acres, and persons of fifty years will be able
to wear silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let
not their times of breeding be neglected, and persons of
seventy years will be able to eat flesh. Let there not be
taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of
the field-allotment of a hundred acres, and the family of
eight mouths will not suffer from hunger. Let careful attention
be paid to the teaching in the various schools, with
repeated inculcation of the filial and fraternal duties, and
gray-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying
burdens on their backs or on their heads. It has never been
that the ruler of a State, where these results were seen, the
old wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired
people suffering neither from hunger nor cold, did not attain
to the Royal dignity."</p>

<h4>PART I</h4>

<p>Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, "When Shun went
into the fields, he cried out and wept towards the pitying
heavens. Why did he cry out and weep?" Mencius replied,
"He was dissatisfied and full of earnest desire."</p>

<p>Wan Chang said, "When his parents love him, a son rejoices
and forgets them not; and when they hate him,
though they punish him, he does not allow himself to be
dissatisfied. Was Shun then dissatisfied with his parents?"
Mencius said, "Ch&lsquo;ang Seih asked Kung-ming Kaou, saying,
'As to Shun's going into the fields, I have received your
instructions; but I do not understand about his weeping
and crying out to the pitying heavens, and to his parents.'
Kung-ming Kaou answered him, 'You do not understand
that matter.' Now Kung-ming Kaou thought that the heart
of a filial son like Shun could not be so free from sorrow
as Seih seemed to imagine he might have been. Shun
would be saying, 'I exert my strength to cultivate the
fields, but I am thereby only discharging my duty as a
son. What is there wrong in me that my parents do not
love me?'</p>

<p>"The emperor caused his own children&mdash;nine sons and
two daughters&mdash;the various officers, oxen and sheep, store-houses
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and granaries, all to be prepared for the service of
Shun amid the channeled fields. Most of the officers in the
empire repaired to him. The emperor designed that he
should superintend the empire along with himself, and
then to transfer it to him. But because his parents were not
in accord with him, he felt like a poor man who has nowhere
to turn to.</p>

<p>"To be an object of complacency to the officers of the
empire is what men desire; but it was not sufficient to remove
the sorrow of Shun. The possession of beauty is what
men desire: but though Shun had for his wives the two
daughters of the emperor, it was not sufficient to remove
his sorrow. Riches are what men desire, but though the
empire was the rich property of Shun, it was not enough
to remove his sorrow. Honors are what men desire, but
though Shun had the dignity of being the son of Heaven,
it was not sufficient to remove his sorrow. The reason why
his being the object of men's complacency, the possession
of beauty, riches, and honors, could not remove his sorrow
was because it could be removed only by his being in entire
accord with his parents.</p>

<p>"The desire of a child is towards his father and mother.
When he becomes conscious of the attractions of beauty,
his desire is towards young and beautiful women. When he
comes to have a wife and children, his desire is towards
them. When he obtains office, his desire is towards his
ruler; and if he cannot get the regard of his ruler, he burns
within. But the man of great filial piety, all his life, has his
desire towards his parents. In the great Shun I see the case
of one whose desire was towards them when he was fifty
years old."</p>

<p>Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, "It is said in the
'Book of Poetry,'</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'How do we proceed in taking a wife?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Announcement must first be made to our parents.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
    If the rule be indeed as thus expressed, no one ought to
have illustrated it so well as Shun&mdash;how was it that Shun's
marriage took place without his informing his parents?"
Mencius replied, "If he had informed them, he would not
have been able to marry. That male and female dwell together
is the greatest of human relations. If Shun had informed
his parents, he must have made void this greatest
of human relations, and incurred thereby their resentment.
It was on this account that he did not inform them."</p>

<p>Wan Chang said, "As to Shun's marrying without making
announcement to his parents, I have heard your instructions.
But how was it that the emperor gave him his
daughters as wives without informing his parents?" Mencius
said, "The emperor also knew that, if he informed his
parents, he could not have given him his daughters as
wives."</p>

<p>Wan Chang said, "His parents set Shun to repair a
granary, and then removed the ladder by which he had
ascended; after which Koo-sow set fire to it. They sent him
to dig a well, from which he managed to get out; but they,
not knowing this, proceeded to cover it up. His brother,
SÃ«ang, said, 'Of this scheme to cover up the city-farming
gentleman the merit is all mine. Let my parents have his
oxen and sheep; let them have his granaries and store-houses.
His shield and spear shall be mine; his lute shall be
mine; his carved bow shall be mine; and I will make his
two wives attend for me to my bed.' SÃ«ang then went away
and entered Shun's house, and there was Shun upon a
couch with his lute. SÃ«ang said, 'I am come simply because
I was thinking anxiously about you,' and at the same time
he looked ashamed. Shun said to him, 'There are all my
officers; do you take the management of them for me.' I do
not know whether Shun was ignorant of SÃ«ang's wishing
to kill him." Mencius replied, "How could he be ignorant
of it? But when SÃ«ang was sorrowful, he was also sorrowful,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and when SÃ«ang was joyful, he was also joyful."</p>

<p>Wan Chang continued, "Then was Shun one who rejoiced
hypocritically?" "No," was the reply. "Formerly
some one sent a present of a live fish to Tsze-ch&lsquo;an of
Ch&lsquo;ing. Tsze-ch&lsquo;an ordered his pond-keeper to feed it in
the pond; but the man cooked it and reported the execution
of his commission, saying, 'When I first let it go, it
looked embarrassed. In a little while it seemed to be somewhat
at ease, and then it swam away as if delighted.' 'It
had got into its element!' said Tsze-ch&lsquo;an. The pond-keeper
went out and said, 'Who calls Tsze-ch&lsquo;an wise? When I
had cooked and eaten the fish, he said, "It has got into its
element! It has got into its element!"' "Thus a superior man
may be imposed on by what seems to be as it ought to be,
but it is difficult to entrap him by what is contrary to right
principle. SÃ«ang came in the way in which the love of his
elder brother would have made him come, and therefore
Shun truly believed him, and rejoiced at it. What hypocrisy
was there?"</p>

<p>Wan Chang said, "SÃ«ang made it his daily business to
kill Shun; why was it that, when the latter was raised to be
the son of Heaven, he only banished him?" Mencius replied,
"He invested him with a State, and some have said
that it was banishing him." When Chang said, "Shun banished
the Superintendent of Works to YÃ«w-chow, sent
away Hwan-tow to Mount Ts&lsquo;ung, slew the Prince of San
MÃ«aou in San-wei, and imprisoned K&lsquo;wan on Mount Yu.
When those four criminals were thus dealt with, all under
heaven submitted to him; it was a cutting off of men who
were destitute of benevolence. But SÃ«ang was of all men
the most destitute of benevolence, and Shun invested him
with the State of Pe; of what crime had the people of Pe
been guilty? Does a benevolent man really act thus? In the
case of other men, he cut them off; in the case of his
brother, he invested him with a State." Mencius replied,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
"A benevolent man does not lay up anger, nor cherish resentment
against his brother, but only regards him with
affection and love. Regarding him with affection, he wishes
him to enjoy honor; loving him, he wishes him to be rich.
The investing him with Pe was to enrich and ennoble him.
If while Shun himself was emperor, his brother had been
a common man, could he have been said to regard him
with affection and love?"</p>

<p>Wan Chang said, "I venture to ask what is meant by
some saying that it was a banishing of SÃ«ang." Mencius
replied, "SÃ«ang could do nothing of himself in his State.
The emperor appointed an officer to manage its government,
and to pay over its revenues to him; and therefore it
was said that it was a banishing of him? How indeed could
he be allowed the means of oppressing the people there?
Nevertheless, Shun wished to be continually seeing him,
and therefore he came unceasingly to court, as is signified
in that expression, 'He did not wait for the rendering of
tribute, or affairs of government, to receive the prince of
Pe.'"</p>

<p>HÃ«en-k&lsquo;Ã«w Mung asked Mencius, saying, "There is the
old saying, 'An officer of complete virtue cannot be employed
as a minister by his ruler, nor treated as a son by
his father.' Shun stood with his face to the south, and Yaou,
at the head of all the feudal princes, appeared in his court
with his face to the north. Koo-sow also appeared at Shun's
court with his face to the north; and when Shun saw him,
his countenance assumed a look of distress. Confucius said,
'At this time the empire was in a perilous condition indeed!
How unsettled was its state!' I do not know whether what
is thus said really took place." Mencius said, "No. These
are not the words of a superior man, but the sayings of an
uncultivated person of the east of Ts&lsquo;e. When Yaou was
old, Shun took the management of affairs for him. It is said
in the Canon of Yaou, 'After twenty-eight years, Fang-heun
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
demised, and the people mourned for him as for a
parent three years. All within the four seas, the eight instruments
of music were stopped and hushed." Confucius
said, "'There are not two suns in the sky, nor two sovereigns
over the people. If Shun had already been in the position
of the son of Heaven, and had moreover led on all the
feudal princes of the empire to observe the three years'
mourning for Yaou, there must in that case have been two
sons of Heaven.'"</p>

<p>HÃ«en-k&lsquo;Ã«w Mung said, "On the point of Shun's not employing
Yaou as a minister, I have received your instructions.
But it is said in the 'Book of Poetry,'</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Under the wide heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All is the king's land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the sea-boundaries of the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All are the king's servants.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When Shun became emperor, I venture to ask how it was
that Koo-sow was not one of his servants." Mencius replied,
"That Ode is not to be understood in that way; it
speaks of being laboriously engaged in the king's business,
and not being able to nourish one's parents, as if the subject
of it said, 'This is all the king's business, but I alone am
supposed to have ability, and made to toil in it.' Therefore
those who explain the Odes must not insist on one term so
as to do violence to a sentence, nor on a sentence so as to
do violence to the general scope. They must try with their
thoughts to meet that scope, and then they will apprehend
it. If we simply take single sentences, there is that in the
Ode called the 'Yun Han,'</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Of the remnant of Chow, among the black-haired people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There will not be half a man left.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If it had really been as thus expressed, then not an individual
of the people of Chow would have been left.</p>

<p>"Of all that a filial son can attain to, there is nothing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
greater than his honoring his parents. Of what can be attained
to in honoring one's parents, there is nothing greater
than the nourishing them with the empire. To be the father
of the son of Heaven is the height of honor. To be nourished
with the empire is the height of nourishment. In this
was verified the sentiment in the 'Book of Poetry,'</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ever thinking how to be filial,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His filial mind was the model which he supplied.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"In the 'Book of History' it is said, 'With respectful service
he appeared before Koo-sow, looking grave and awestruck,
till Koo-sow also was transformed by his example.'
This is the true case of the scholar of complete virtue not
being treated as a son by his father."</p>

<p>Wan Chang said, "It is said that Yaou gave the empire
to Shun; was it so?" Mencius replied, "No; the emperor
cannot give the empire to another." "Yes; but Shun possessed
the empire. Who gave it to him?" "Heaven gave it
to him," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Heaven gave it to him? Did Heaven confer the appointment
on him with specific injunctions?" Mencius said,
"No. Heaven does not speak. It simply showed its will by
his personal conduct, and by his conduct of affairs."</p>

<p>"'It showed its will by his personal conduct, and by his
conduct of affairs,'" returned the other; "how was this?"
Mencius said, "The emperor can present a man to Heaven,
but he cannot make Heaven give that man the empire. A
feudal prince can present a man to the emperor to take his
place, but he cannot make the emperor give the princedom
to that man. A great officer can present a man to his prince,
but he cannot cause the prince to make that man a great
officer in his own room. Anciently Yaou presented Shun to
Heaven, and Heaven accepted him; he displayed him to
the people, and the people accepted him. Therefore I say,
'Heaven does not speak. It simply indicated its will by his
personal conduct, and by his conduct of affairs.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
    Chang said, "I presume to ask how it was that Yaou presented
Shun to Heaven, and Heaven accepted him, and
displayed him to the people, and the people accepted
him." The reply was, "He caused him to preside over the
sacrifices, and all the Spirits were well pleased with them;
thus it was that Heaven accepted him. He caused him to
preside over the conduct of affairs, and affairs were well
administered, so that all the people reposed under him;
thus it was that the people accepted him. Heaven gave the
empire to him, and the people gave it to him. Therefore I
said, 'The emperor cannot give the empire to another.'</p>

<p>"Shun assisted Yaou in the government for twenty and
eight years; this was more than man could have done, and
was from Heaven. When the three years' mourning consequent
on the death of Yaou were accomplished, Shun
withdrew from the son of Yaou to the south of the southern
Ho. The princes of the empire, however, repairing to
court, went not to the son of Yaou, but to Shun. Litigants
went not to the son of Yaou, but to Shun. Singers sang not
the son of Yaou, but Shun. Therefore I said that it was
Heaven that gave him the empire. It was after this that he
went to the Middle State, and occupied the seat of the son
of Heaven. If he had before these things taken up his residence
in the palace of Yaou, and applied pressure to his
son, it would have been an act of usurpation, and not the
gift of Heaven.</p>

<p>"This view of Shun's obtaining the empire is in accordance
with what is said in The Great Declaration&mdash;'Heaven
sees as my people see, Heaven hears as my people hear.'"</p>

<p>Wan Chang said, "People say, 'When the disposal of the
empire came to Yu, his virtue was inferior to that of Yaou
and Shun, and he did not transmit it to the worthiest, but
to his son.' Was it so?" Mencius replied, "No; it was not so.
When Heaven gave the empire to the worthiest, it was
given to the worthiest; when Heaven gave it to the son of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the preceding emperor, it was given to that son. Formerly
Shun presented Yu to Heaven for a period of seventeen
years; and when the three years' mourning, consequent on
the death of Shun, were accomplished, Yu withdrew from
the son of Yu to Yang-shing. The people of the empire followed
him as, after the death of Yaou, they had not followed
his son, but followed Shun. Yu presented Yih to
Heaven for a period of seven years; and when the three
years' mourning consequent on the death of Yu were accomplished,
Yih withdrew from the son of Yu to the north
of Mount Ke. The princes repairing to court, and litigants,
went not to Yih, but to K&lsquo;e, saying, 'He is the son of our
ruler.' Singers did not sing Yih, but they sang K&lsquo;e, saying,
'He is the son of our ruler.'</p>

<p>"That Tan-choo was not equal to his father, and Shun's
son also not equal to his; that Shun assisted Yaou, and Yu
assisted Shun, for a period of many years, conferring benefits
on the people for a long time; that K&lsquo;e was virtuous
and able, and could reverently enter into and continue the
ways of Yu; that Yih assisted Yu for a period of a few
years, conferring benefits on the people not for a long
time; that the length of time that Shun, Yu, and Yih, assisted
in the government was so different; and that the sons
of the emperors were one a man of talents and virtue, and
the other two inferior to their fathers:&mdash;all these things
were from Heaven, and what could not be produced by
man. That which is done without any one's seeming to do
it is from Heaven. That which comes to pass without any
one's seeming to bring it about is from Heaven.</p>

<p>"In the case of a private man's obtaining the empire,
there must be in him virtue equal to that of Shun and Yu,
and moreover there must be the presenting him to Heaven
by the preceding emperor. It was on this latter account
that Chung-ne did not obtain the kingdom.</p>

<p>"When the throne descends by natural succession, he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
who is displaced by Heaven must be like KÃ«eh or Chow.
It was on this account that Yih, E Yin, and the duke of
Chow did not obtain the kingdom.</p>

<p>"E Yin assisted T&lsquo;ang so that he became sovereign of the
kingdom. After the demise of T&lsquo;ang, T&lsquo;ae-ting having died
without being appointed in his place, Wae-ping reigned
two years, and Chung-jin four. T&lsquo;ae-KÃ«ah then was turning
upside down the canons and examples of T&lsquo;ang, and
E Yin placed him in T&lsquo;ung for three years. There he repented
of his errors, was contrite, and reformed himself.
In T&lsquo;ung he came to dwell in benevolence and moved towards
righteousness, during those three years listening to
the lessons given to him by E Yin, after which that minister
again returned with him to Poh.</p>

<p>"The duke of Chow's not getting the kingdom was like
that of Yih's not getting the throne of HÃ«a, or E Yin's that
of Yin.</p>

<p>"Confucius said, 'T&lsquo;ang and Yu resigned the throne to
the worthiest; the founders of the HÃ«a, Yin, and Chow
dynasties transmitted it to their sons. The principle of
righteousness was the same in all the cases.'"</p>

<p>Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, "People say that E
Yin sought an introduction to T&lsquo;ang by his knowledge of
cookery; was it so?" Mencius replied, "No, it was not so.
E Yin was farming in the lands of the State of Sin, delighting
in the principles of Yaou and Shun. In any matter contrary
to the righteousness which they prescribed, or to the
course which they enjoined, though he had been salaried
with the empire, he would not have regarded it; though
there had been yoked for him a thousand teams, he would
not have looked at them. In any matter contrary to the
righteousness which they prescribed, or to the course
which they enjoined, he would not have given nor taken
even a single straw.</p>

<p>"T&lsquo;ang sent persons with presents of silk to ask him to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
enter his service. With an air of indifference and self-satisfaction,
he said, 'What can I do with these silks with
which T&lsquo;ang invites me? Is it not best for me to abide in
these channeled fields, and therein delight myself with the
principles of Yaou and Shun?'</p>

<p>"T&lsquo;ang thrice sent persons thus to invite him. After this,
with the change of purpose displayed in his countenance,
he spoke in a different style, saying, 'Instead of abiding in
the channeled fields, and therein delighting myself with
the principles of Yaou and Shun, had I not better make this
ruler one after the style of Yaou and Shun? had I not better
make this people like the people of Yaou and Shun?
had I not better in my own person see these things for
myself? Heaven's plan in the production of this people is
this:&mdash;That they who are first informed, should instruct
those who are later in being informed, and those who
first apprehend principles should instruct those who are
slower to do so. I am the one of Heaven's people who have
first apprehended; I will take these principles and instruct
this people in them. If I do not instruct them, who will do
so?'</p>

<p>"He thought that among all the people of the kingdom,
even the private men and women, if there were any that
did not enjoy such benefits as Yaou and Shun conferred,
it was as if he himself pushed them into a ditch. He took
upon himself the heavy charge of all under Heaven in this
way, and therefore he went to T&lsquo;ang, and pressed upon
him the duty of attacking HÃ«a, and saving the people.</p>

<p>"I have not heard of one who bent himself and at the
same time made others straight; how much less could one
disgrace himself, and thereby rectify the whole kingdom?
The actions of the sages have been different.
Some have kept far away from office, and others have
drawn near to it; some have left their offices, and others
have not done so; that in which these different courses all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
meet, is simply the keeping of their persons pure.</p>

<p>"I have heard that E Yin sought an introduction to
T&lsquo;ang by the principles of Yaou and Shun; I have not
heard he did so by his knowledge of cookery.</p>

<p>"In the 'Instructions of E,' it is said, 'Heaven, destroying
KÃ«eh, commenced attacking him in the palace of Muh; we
commenced in Poh.'"</p>

<p>Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, "Some say that Confucius
in Wei lived with an ulcer-doctor, and in Ts&lsquo;e with
Tseih Hwan, the chief of the eunuchs; was it so?" Mencius
said, "No, it was not so. Those are the inventions of men
fond of strange things.</p>

<p>"In Wei he lived in the house of Yen Ch&lsquo;ow-yÃ«w. The
wife of the officer Mei and the wife of Tsze-lu were sisters.
Mei-tsze spoke to Tsze-lu, saying, 'If Confucius will lodge
with me, he may get to be a high noble of Wei.' Tsze-lu reported
this to Confucius, who said, 'That is as ordered by
Heaven.' Confucius advanced according to propriety, and
retired according to righteousness. In regard to his obtaining
office and honor or not obtaining them, he said, 'That
is as ordered.' But if he had lodged with an ulcer-doctor
and with Tseih Hwan, the chief of the eunuchs, that would
neither have been according to righteousness nor any ordering
of Heaven.</p>

<p>"When Confucius, being dissatisfied in Lu and Wei, had
left those States, he met with the attempt of Hwan, the
master of the Horse, in Sung, to intercept and kill him, so
that he had to pass through Sung in the dress of a private
man. At that time, though he was in circumstances of distress,
he lodged in the house of Ching-tsze, the minister of
works, who was then a minister of Chow, the marquis of
Ch&lsquo;in.</p>

<p>"I have heard that ministers in the service of a court may
be known from those to whom they are hosts, and that
ministers coming from a distance may be known from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
those with whom they lodge. If Confucius had lodged with
an ulcer-doctor and with Tseih Hwan, the chief of the
eunuchs, how could he have been Confucius?"</p>

<p>Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, "Some say that Pih-le
He sold himself to a cattle-keeper of Ts&lsquo;in for five sheepskins,
and fed his cattle for him, to seek an introduction to
Duke Muh of Ts&lsquo;in; is this true?" Mencius said, "No, it
was not so. This is the invention of some one fond of
strange things.</p>

<p>"Pih-le He was a man of Yu. The people of Ts&lsquo;in by the
inducement of a <i>peih</i> of Ch&lsquo;uy-Keih and a team of KÃ«uh-ch&lsquo;an
horses were asking liberty to march through Yu to
attack Kwoh. Kung Che-k&lsquo;e remonstrated with the duke of
Yu, asking him not to grant their request, but Pih-le He
did not remonstrate.</p>

<p>"When he knew that the duke of Yu was not to be remonstrated
with, and went in consequence from that State
to Ts&lsquo;in, he had reached the age of seventy. If by that time
he did not know that it would be a disgraceful thing to
seek for an introduction to Duke Muh of Ts&lsquo;in by feeding
cattle, could he be called wise? But not remonstrating
where it was of no use to remonstrate, could he be said not
to be wise? Knowing that the duke of Yu would be ruined,
and leaving his State before that event, he could not be
said to be not wise. As soon as he was advanced in Ts&lsquo;in,
he knew that Duke Muh was one with whom he could
have a field for action, and became chief minister to him;
could he be said to be not wise? Acting as chief minister in
Ts&lsquo;in, he made his ruler distinguished throughout the kingdom,
and worthy to be handed down to future ages; if he
had not been a man of talents and virtue, could he have
done this? As to selling himself in order to bring about the
destruction of his ruler, even a villager who had a regard
for himself, would not do such a thing; and shall we say
that a man of talents and virtue did it?"</p>

<h1>THE SHI-KING</h1>
<h2>[<i>Metrical translation by James Legge</i>]</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 142]<br />[Pg 143]</a></span></p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The wisdom of Confucius as a social reformer, as a teacher
and guide of the Chinese people, is shown in many ways.
He not only gave them a code of personal deportment,
providing them with rules for the etiquette and ceremony
of life, but he instilled into them that profound spirit of
domestic piety which is one of the strongest features in the
Chinese character. He took measures to secure also the intellectual
cultivation of his followers, and his Five Canons
contain all the most ancient works of Chinese literature,
in the departments of poetry, history, philosophy, and legislation.
The Shi-King is a collection of Chinese poetry
made by Confucius himself. This great anthology consists
of more than three hundred pieces, covering the whole
range of Chinese lyric poetry, the oldest of which dates
some eighteen centuries before Christ, while the latest of
the selections must have been written at the beginning of
the sixth century before Christ. These poems are of the
highest interest, and even nowadays may be read with delight
by Europeans. The ballad and the hymn are among
the earliest forms of national poetry, and the contents of
the Shi-King naturally show specimens of lyric poetry of
this sort. We find there not only hymns, but also ballads of
a really fine and spirited character. Sometimes the poems
celebrate the common pursuits, occupations, and incidents
of life. They rise to the exaltation of the epithalamium, or
of the vintage song; at other times they deal with sentiment
and human conduct, being in the highest degree sententious
and epigrammatic. We must give the credit to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Confucius of having saved for us the literature of China,
and of having set his people an example in preserving the
monuments of a remote antiquity. While the literatures of
ancient Greece and Rome have largely perished in the
convulsions that followed the breaking up of the Roman
empire in Europe, when the kingdom of China fell into
disorder and decrepitude this one great teacher stepped
forward to save the precious record of historic fact, philosophical
thought, and of legislation as well as poetry, from
being swept away by the deluge of revolution. Confucius
showed his wisdom by the high value he set upon the
poetry of his native land, and his name must be set side by
side with that of the astute tyrant of Athens who collected
the poems of Homer and preserved them as a precious
heritage to the Greek world. Confucius has given us his
opinion with regard to the poems of the Shi-King. No man,
he says, is worth speaking to who has not mastered the
poems of an anthology, the perusal of which elevates the
mind and purifies it from all corrupt thoughts. Thanks to
the work of modern scholarship, English readers can now
verify this dictum for themselves.</p>

<h3>CELEBRATING THE GOODNESS OF THE DESCENDANTS OF<br />
KING WAN</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As the feet of the <i>lin</i>, which avoid each living thing,<br /></span>

<span class="i7">They are the <i>lin</i>!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The "lin" is the female of "K&lsquo;e"&mdash;a fabulous animal&mdash;the symbol
of all goodness and benevolence; having the body of a deer, the tail
of an ox, the hoofs of a horse, one horn, the scales of a fish, etc. Its feet
do not tread on any living thing&mdash;not even on live grass; it does not butt
with its forehead; and the end of its horn is covered with flesh&mdash;to show
that, while able for war, it wills to have peace. The "lin" was supposed to
appear inaugurating a golden age, but the poet finds a better auspice of
that in the character of Wan's family and kindred.]</p>

<span class="i0">The general came, and there with ardor strove<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A note of zeal throughout the host to sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Direct from court I come, by orders bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The march to hasten";&mdash;it was thus he spake.<br /></span>

    <span class="i0">The guiding standard was on high upreared,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">While oxtails, crest-like, did the staff's top grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We watched the sheet unfolding grandly wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each flag around showed falcons on its face.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The snow falls fast, the mire impedes our feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Many the hardships we were called to meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the King's orders we had all fulfilled.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No rest we had; often our friends to greet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The longing came; but vain regrets we stilled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By tablets stern our hearts with fresh resolve were thrilled.<br /></span>
</div>

<span class="i0">"Incessant chirp the insects in the grass;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Oh! could we see them, what relief 'twould bring!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hearts, rejoiced, at once would feel at rest."<br /></span>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The spring days now are lengthening out their light;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The plants and trees are dressed in living green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The orioles resting sing, or wing their flight;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our wives amid the southern-wood are seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which white they bring, to feed their silkworms keen.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our host, returned, sweeps onwards to the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where chiefs are questioned, shown the captives mean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nan Chung, majestic, draws the gaze of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud o'er the barbarous foe his victories to recall.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The royal Wan now rests on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enshrined in brightness of the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chow as a state had long been known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Heaven's decree at last was shown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its lords had borne a glorious name;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">King Wan ruled well when earth he trod;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now moves his spirit near to God.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A strong-willed, earnest king was Wan,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From age to age more lustrous grow.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">More lustrous still from age to age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All reverent plans their zeal engage;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sons of Shang must bend the knee;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sons of Shang, each one a king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In numbers beyond numbering.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet as God spoke, so must it be:&mdash;<br /></span>
